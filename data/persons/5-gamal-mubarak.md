  Gamal, Mubarak's younger son who was said to succeed his father as a president, 
  was educated at the American University of Cairo and spent six years working as 
  an investment banker for Bank of America in Egypt and also in London. In London, 
  Gamal and his wife Khadiga lived in a luxurious propoerty in wealthy 
  Knightsbridge. Gamal founded an investment advisory firm, Med Invest Partners, 
  which helped Western investors seeking to purchase stocks and companies in 
  Egypt.
  Children of Hosni Mubarak, mainly Gamal Mubarak, have aquired their fortune by 
  ensuring that companies coming to Egypt pay from 5 percent to 20 percent 
  commission fee to one of their companies. Under Egyptian law, foreign businesses 
  are required to give a local partners a 51-percent stake in their Egyptian 
  operations and such local partners were usually connected to Mubarak's network 
  of family and allies.
