Following the revolutions in 2011 and 2014 in Tunisia, Egypt, and Ukraine, the
Council of the European Union imposed misappropriation sanctions on members of
the previous regimes.

The European Union asked its 28 member states to freeze the assets of former
presidents, their families and partners, including bank accounts, houses and
other properties.

Misappropriation sanctions are important because they show that there are
consequences to corruption and that corrupt officials cannot escape by hiding
money abroad. But how do they work and are they helping in returning the assets
to Egypt, Tunisia and Ukraine?
