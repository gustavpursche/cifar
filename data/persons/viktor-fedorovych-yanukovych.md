  Viktor Yanukovych served as President of Ukraine from February 2010 until
  February 2014 when he was removed from power as a result of the Ukrainian
  revolution. During his term, Viktor Yanukovych gained a huge amount of
  properties that were either seized from state ownership or built with
  violations of the law. One such example is his luxurious residence Mezhygira,
  initially state-wned but later privatised and enhanced from unknown income.
  The area of the residence has its own helicopter ground, a zoo, a collection
  of cars, a golf course, a dairy farm and a restaurant. The exact amount of
  stolen by Yanukovych is still unknown. The estimated damage to the state
  budget varies up to 40 and even 100 billion USD. [Source 1]
