The use of brutal force against protesters of the Maidan revolution by the president Yanukovych and his government, together with the misuse of power and pressure on independent press and political opponents all contributed towards the ousting of the president and his allies.

Suspected forms of embezzlement common in the Yanukovych era include theft, corrupt awarding of projects, rigged energy prices and the misuse of carbon-emissions allowances. It is believed the total sum embezzled could be as high as $37 billion.
