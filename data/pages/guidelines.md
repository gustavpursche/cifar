As well as assisting the countries of origin, businesses have a role and responsibilities to both
report and to act when there is a suspicion that they are dealing with people subject to
sanctions.

As well as assisting the countries of origin, businesses have a role and responsibilities to both
report and to act when there is a suspicion that they are dealing with people subject to
sanctions.

EU misappropriation sanctions are only one type of sanctions that businesses need to be aware
of when performing due diligence investigation. The information on this website does not
provide a comprehensive list of all sanctions nor can it replace legal advice. This website should
be used as a resource to inform businesses about misappropriation sanctions and to aid the
identification of designated persons.

There is a number of processes that your company or institution can adopt in order to minimize the risk of non-compliance with sanctions. Depending on your business model and risk factors, these may include:

- Have a sanctions policy in place
- Have a monitoring system to ensure compliance with sanctions at all times
- Raise awareness of sanctions-compliance amongst your staff
- Identify and establish a communication channel with your national competent authority

All EU nationals and legal entities established under EU law must comply with the EU sanctions that are in force, irrespective of where their activities take place. Failure to comply with sanctions might result in a criminal prosecution or a monetary penalty.

As soon as practicable, EU regulations require natural and legal persons, entities and bodies to provide their national competent authorities with information that would facilitate compliance with the regulations. In case you might be dealing with a designated entity or you are unsure of your reporting obligations, you should seek independent legal advice or contact the relevant national competent authority from the list below.
