A former Air Force officer, Hosni Mubarak was sworn into power in 1981, after 
the assassination of president Anwar Sadat. 
During his 30 year rule, Mubarak, his family and his close circle of advisers 
are alleged to have enriched themselves through partnerships in powerful 
Egyptian companies and stashed a large part of this wealth abroad, with media 
sources estimating this fortune at up to US$70 billion. Mubarak and his sons, 
Gamal Mubrarak and Alaa Mubarak, served three to four-year jail sentences on 
charges of embezzlement in Egypt after the 2011 revolution and were ordered to 
pay a $17.5 million fine. In March 2017, Hosni Mubarak was released from 
detention after being acquitted of charges of killing protesters during the 
revolution, but remains under investigation for alleged corruption. He is said 
to reside in his private family residence in Cairo’s upscale district of 
Heliopolis. [1](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12301713)
