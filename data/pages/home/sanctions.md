Following the revolutions in 2011 and 2014 Tunisia, Egypt, and Ukraine, the
Council of the European Union imposed misappropriation sanctions on corrupt
members of the previous regimes. EU member states then froze assets
(bank accounts, properties, cars) of former presidents, their families and
business partners.
