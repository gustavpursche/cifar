Gamal, Mubarak's younger son, who was said to be planning to succeed his father 
as a president, was educated at the American University of Cairo and spent six 
years working as an investment banker for Bank of America in Egypt and also in 
London. In London, Gamal and his wife Khadiga lived in a luxurious property in 
Knightsbridge. Gamal founded an investment advisory firm, Med Invest Partners, 
which helped Western investors seeking to purchase stocks and companies in 
Egypt.
Together with his brother Alaa, he is alleged to have aquired his fortune by 
levying commissions on foreign companies. Accoridng to the Egyptian law, foreign 
companies were required to have local partners, which in most cases were 
conected to the Mubarak family or the ruling party. Alongisde his father and 
brother, Gamal was initially sentenced for three years in prison for diverting 
millions of public money to maintain presidential palaces. In September 2018, 
Gamal was arrested, together with his brother Alaa, and accused of manipulating 
the stock market.
