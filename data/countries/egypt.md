Over the period of 30 years, former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, his family
and close circle of advisers are alleged to have enriched themselves through partnerships in
powerful Egyptian companies, profiting from their political power. While the illicit nature of the alleged activity makes it
difficult to determine a precise figure, some estimates peg Mubarakâ€™s family
fortune as being between US $40 to $70 billion. Following the Egyptian revolution in 2011, the EU established misappropriation sanctions covering Mubarak and several high-profile officials. [1](https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/flowchart/2011/02/11/how-hosni-mubarak-got-filthy-rich)
