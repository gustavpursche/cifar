,,,"Over the last 30 years, former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, his family and close circle of advisers enriched themselves through partnerships in powerful Egyptian companies, profiting from their political power and illicit enrichment from public money, according to numerous reports. 

While the illicit nature of the activity makes it difficult to determine a precise figure, estimates indicate Mubarak’s family has a net worth of at least $5 billion, with some media reports pegging the family fortune at between $40 and $70 billion. 

Mubarak and his two sons Alaa and Gamal have been charged and sent to prison for three years for embezzlement. After a several years of investigation, Alaa and Gamal have been sent back to prison in 2018 after the Egyptian Criminal Court ordered their arrests for stock market manipulation. 

The former Egyptian president and his family suspected to have used the 18 days it took for his regime to topple in the beginning of year 2011 to shift his vast wealth overseas. Evidence shows that their wealth—obtained from illegal activities—was deposited or invested in many different countries. 
Switzerland alone has frozen $650 million, from which only $34 million has been returned. 

Total number of individuals under the sanctions: currently 9 (originally 19)
