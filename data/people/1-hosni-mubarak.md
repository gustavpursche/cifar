The former Air Force officer, Hosni Mubarak, was sworn into power in 1981, after 
the assassination of a former president Anwar Sadat. (Sadat's family members and 
number of "prominent members of Sadat’s circle were slapped with criminal 
charges for misusing their power and other corrupt practices). 
But during the 30 year-long reign, Mubarak, his family and his close circle of 
advisers have enriched themselves through partnerships in powerful Egyptian 
companies and stashed a lot of this wealth abroad. The exposure of Mubarak's 
wealth by media, which has been assessed by some as high as $70 billion was a 
catalyst for people in Egypt, that time experiencing a chronic lack of jobs, who 
took to streets and pressured Mubarak to step down.  
In 2014, 'Hosni Mubarak and his sons Gamal and Alaa Mubarak received three and 
four-year jail sentences on charges of embezzlement and were ordered to pay a 
$17.5 million fine. In March 2017, Hosni Mubarak was released from detention 
after being acquitted of charges of killing protesters but remains under 
investigation for alleged corruption. Mubarak is said to reside in his private 
family residence in Cairo’s upscale district of Heliopolis.
