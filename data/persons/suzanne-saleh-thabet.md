  Mubarak's wife Suzanne, was born to a Wesh mother and an Egyptian father.  She
  met Mubarak when she was only 16 years old, which whom they had together two
  sons; Alaa Mubarak and Gamal Mubarak. Widespread rumours were giving her power
  behind the scenes of her husband’s presidency and support of her son Gamal as
  Mubarak's successor, which she denied.  As First Lady, she was known for her
  charitable work and attended many important world events, and she served
  goodwill ambassador for the U.N.'s Food and Agricultural Organization. After
  the ousting of her husband, her charitable work came under srutiny and she has
  been investigted for corruption. One such case has been an alleged
  misappropriation of funds and donations related to the Alexandria Library.
