Mubarak's wife Suzanne was born to a Wesh mother and an Egyptian father. She met 
Mubarak when she was only 16 years old, with whom they had together two sons; 
Alaa Mubarak and Gamal Mubarak. As First Lady, she was known for her charitable 
work and attended many important world events, and she served as a goodwill 
ambassador for the U.N.'s Food and Agricultural Organization. After the ousting 
of her husband, her charitable work came under srutiny and she has been 
investigted for corruption. One such case has been an alleged misappropriation 
of funds and donations related to the Alexandria Library.
