The Jasmine Revolution that broke out in Tunisia in December 2017 eventually led to the end of a 23-year-old reign of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and started what became known as the Arab Spring. 

Together with 48 individuals, mostly part of his extended family network, Ben Ali has been accused by the Tunisian authorities to have illegally acquired assets and had to step down. Ben Aliâ€™s net worth has been estimated at $17 billion.[Source 1]( https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20180114-tunisias-jasmine-revolution/), [Source 2]( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/13/tunisia-11bn-hidden-funds-ben-ali)
