Ex-president of Tunisia was born in Hamman-Sousse 3 September 1936. He was a 
president for 23 years before stepping down in January 2011 due to a wave of 
demonstrations, that have seen several protesters killed. Over his long rule, 
Ben Ali's extended family were said to take control over many areas of Tunisia's 
business. After the regime fell, Tunisian authorities seized 220 companies owned 
by the family members which controlled 21% of private sector profits. Ben Ali 
and his wife Leïla Trabelsi were found guilty in absentia by a Tunisian court 
for embezzlement and misuse of public funds, and sentenced to 35 years in 
prison. However, they both currently remain in Saudi Arabia, together with their 
children Halima and Mohamed.
