As the Ukraine's former First Deputy Prime Minister, Azrubov became interim 
Prime Minister following the resignation of Mykola Azarov in January 2014. A 
month later, on 27 February 2014, he was dismissed. There are several criminal 
proceedings against Azrubov ongoing in Ukraine for misappropriation and seizure 
of property and funds by abuse of his position.
