Minister of Interior since 1997 until the revolution in January 2011. After the 
revolution, Habib el-Adly was initially sent to prison for 12 years and fined 
$2.5 million for corruption conviction but in 2014 the charges were dropped. 
Initially fleeing the country, he was arrested in the fall of 2017. Together 
with Hosni Mubarak and several other officials, el-Adly was also cleared of 
charges related to killing protesters during the 2011 uprising. In 2017, he 
attempted to flee Egypt but was arrested to serve his sentence from earlier that 
year - seven years for embezzlement. This sentense was later revoked and there 
has not been a final court decision yet.
