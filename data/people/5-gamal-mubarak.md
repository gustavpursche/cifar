Gamal, Mubarak's younger son who was said to succeed his father as a president, 
was educated at the American University of Cairo and spent six years working as 
an investment banker for Bank of America in Egypt and also in London. In London, 
Gamal and his wife Khadiga lived in a luxurious propoerty in wealthy 
Knightsbridge. Gamal founded an investment advisory firm, Med Invest Partners, 
which helped Western investors seeking to purchase stocks and companies in 
Egypt.
Children of Hosni Mubarak, mainly Gamal Mubarak, have aquired their fortune by 
ensuring that companies coming to Egypt pay from 5 percent to 20 percent 
commission fee to one of their companies. Under Egyptian law, foreign businesses 
are required to give a local partners a 51-percent stake in their Egyptian 
operations and such local partners were usually connected to Mubarak's network 
of family and allies.
