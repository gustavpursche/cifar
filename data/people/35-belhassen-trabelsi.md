Brother-in-law of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali is a businessman. As one of the most 
powerful members of the former Tunisian regime, he was convicted for corruption 
in absentia in 2011 and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Belhassen resided in 
Canada for several years but he has disappeared off the radar of Canadian 
authorities when threatened with deportation.
