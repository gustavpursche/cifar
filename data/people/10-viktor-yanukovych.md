Viktor Yanukovych served as President of Ukraine from February 2010 until 
February 2014 when he was removed from power as a result of the Ukrainian 
revolution. During his term, Viktor Yanukovych is alleged to have gained a huge 
amount of properties that were either seized from state ownership or built 
unlawfully. One such example is his luxurious residence Mezhygira, initially 
state-owned but later privatised and enhanced from unknown income. The area of 
the residence has its own helicopter ground, a zoo, a collection of cars, a golf 
course, a dairy farm and a restaurant. The exact amount of money alleged to have 
been stolen by Yanukovych is still unknown. The estimated damage to the state 
budget varies from $40 to $100 billion.
