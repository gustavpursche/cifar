Son-in-law of the former President, businessperson and former head of the 
Tunisian National Olympic Committee, he fled to the United Arab Emirates after 
the revolution. Reports suggest his properties in Tunisia were confiscated, as 
well as his property in Switzerland. He returned to Tunisia in 2014 and was 
arrested on arrival. He entered into a reconcilliation agreement with 
authorities in 2016.
