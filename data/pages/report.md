## Introduction

Public discourse tends to consider sanctions as tool of security policy, often overlooking the existence of sanctions imposed to address the misappropriation of state assets. Media reporting on the current EU sanctions regime on Russia/Ukraine highlights the sanctions regimes affecting Russian targets for their support of destabilisation in Eastern Ukraine, as well as the embargo on Crimea. However, the existence of a sanctions regime freezing the assets misappropriated by members of the political elite ousted in the spring of 2014 hardly receives any attention.

Yet, while the EU has been imposing sanctions for decades under its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), the use of sanctions to address misappropriation of state assets represents a novel application of this tool. It emerged in response to the Arab uprisings of 2011, and it was employed again in the aftermath of regime change in Ukraine. However, after the Maidan crisis, the EU has not applied assets freezes elsewhere. These cases are unique in the context of CFSP sanctions policy, as they constitute the only instances in which sanctions applied to leaders who have been deposed rather than in office, and the only assets freezes unaccompanied by visa bans.

After a life span of roughly four to seven years, the application of asset freezes under the CFSP to address cases of misappropriation does not boast a satisfactory record. The freezes have run into trouble: Following the initial freezing, the lack of criminal convictions of the individuals by their country’s judicial systems has not allowed moving ahead with asset recovery. In addition, some of the targets have successfully challenged their designation in front of EU courts, which have annulled their listing due to insufficient evidence. The EU’s inability to maintain the freezing of assets swiftly effected after the ousting of the governments of Tunisia, Egypt and Ukraine has been mournfully described as a “short-term success but a long-term failure”. #Boogaerts 2018#

In light of this suboptimal state of affairs, the project aims to investigate the following questions:

 1. Whether CFSP sanctions have proved effective in combatting misappropriation of state assets;
 2. Which obstacles impede or limit the effectiveness of these sanctions as a tool for asset recovery; and
 3. How does the use of misappropriation sanctions compare to alternative tools for asset recovery. This question will focus on the possible complementarity of or competition with available tools.

Ultimately, the objective of the study is to generate knowledge that can inform the actions of civil society organisations active in the field, such as Civil Forum for Asset Recovery (CiFAR) and Transparency International (TI). Currently, such knowledge is unavailable. Existing research cannot be relied upon for this purpose: Scholarship has produced some studies on the impact of blacklists on individuals. However, such research has focused on the measures’ impacts on the behaviour of designees #Cosgrove 2005; Wallensteen and Grusell 2012# or on the political dynamics in the country affected #Portela 2010# rather than on their ability to facilitate asset recovery. Thus, a misappropriation angle is missing. The proposed study aims to address this gap, focusing on the EU’s experience.

The present investigation proceeds as follows. First, it outlines the EU’s use of assets freezes to address misappropriation of state funds, identifying their aims and evaluating their efficacy. Secondly, based on the information available, it attempts an explanation of the selectivity with which this tool has been employed so far: it entails only three cases, all of which occurred in the period from 2011 to 2014. The following section will delve into the characteristics of existing EU legislation, performing an analysis of the legal instrument at hand and comparing it to the Swiss legislative model addressing the same issue. This will be followed by case studies exploring the three instances of application of asset freezes: Tunisia, Egypt and Ukraine. After that, a brief look is taken at the asset recovery efforts in Uzbekistan, where no CFSP measures were applied and at the UN assets freezes in Libya for comparative purposes. To conclude, a final section looks at the “big picture”, conducting a global evaluation and presenting the overall findings, providing a response to the opening questions.

## Asset freezes as CFSP Sanctions

Before analysing the EU´s employment of asset freezes to address, it is necessary to outline the decision-making framework in which the decision was framed, and contextualise it in the CFSP practice. The assets freezes were agreed under the foreign policy coordination framework of the EU, the CFSP. Given that the CFSP is an intergovernmental forum, each member state has one vote and decisions must be adopted by unanimity. Therefore, each member state has formally a veto. CFSP sanctions are adopted in pursuance of the objectives of the EU’s external action as stipulated in art 21(2) of the Treaty on European Union, which include, among others, to consolidate and support democracy, the rule of law, human rights and the principles of international law; and to foster the sustainable economic, social and environmental development of developing countries. #European Union (2008) Treaty on European Union, art 21(2)#

A ‘Council Decision’ is first adopted under Title V of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). This act represents the political decision to wield sanctions. Because they have a bearing on the single market, economic and financial measures must then be implemented through the Community. Accordingly, they require the adoption of a regulation under the first pillar, which gives effect to the bans reflected in the previous act. Because decisions affecting the common market must be adopted under a different legal framework, namely the European Community (EC), an EC regulation under qualified majority voting (QMV) follows the CFSP measure. The current legal basis is Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which explicitly provides for the adoption of sanctions against third countries as well as individuals, groups and non-state entities. It reads:

> 1. Where a decision, adopted in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title V of the Treaty on European Union, provides for the interruption or reduction, in part or completely, of economic and financial relations with one or more third countries, the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a joint proposal from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Commission, shall adopt the necessary measures. It shall inform the European Parliament thereof.

> 2. Where a decision adopted in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title V of the Treaty on European Union so provides, the Council may adopt restrictive measures under the procedure referred to in paragraph 1 against natural or legal persons and groups or non-State entities.

Once sanctions are enacted, they are subjected to periodic renewal, normally every twelve months. Renewals take the form of Council Decisions and must again be agreed upon by unanimity. Under the current treaty, the Court of the Justice of European Union (CJEU) has limited powers in the CFSP. However, sanctions imposed against individuals are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court, which established in 2008 that it is competent to review the conformity of CFSP designations with fundamental rights. #Happold 2016# As a result, sanctions regulations must provide adequate safeguards to protect the fundamental rights of those affected by the measures. #TFEU, Art. 215(3).#

## The Use of Assets Freezes for Asset Recovery by the EU: Aims and Efficacy

Sanctions scholarship has long recognised that their success should not be measured just in terms of their contribution to the achievement of a change of behaviour in the targeted leadership. Sanctions fulfil a number of functions beyond forcing compliance, and they can be evaluated with reference to the various roles they play. Various authors have pointed to a myriad of roles played by sanctions other than coercion. They can limit the military or economic capacity of the target, thereby preventing them from pursuing undesirable policies. They may also deter third countries from following a similar course. #Barber 1979# They can be used to support or protect activists or political opponents exposed to state repression. Imposing sanctions can also improve the image of the leaders who advocate them. Importantly, they can be employed to position international actors strategically in the context of an international dispute. #Taylor 2009# The differentiated evaluation of multiple goals is gradually establishing itself in sanctions research. #Biersteker et al. 2016# In order to assess the efficacy of the measures, their objectives must be first ascertained. The success or failure of sanctions can only be evaluated against their goals.

Misappropriation sanctions are sanctions regimes that differ fundamentally from the rest of CFSP sanctions. They are seen and treated as special cases by EU authorities. For officials from EU member states, standard CFSP sanctions are meant to compel the target to change course, and deter specific forms of behaviour. By contrast, misappropriation regimes were not conceived as means of pressure to bring about a specific outcome from the targeted individuals or country authorities. #Boogaerts 2018# Instead, the assets freezes were imposed with a two-fold intention in mind, one of them is rather technical in nature, while the other is political. #The following account relies on information obtained from a desk review of literature, as well as anonymous interviews with representatives from various EU member states in Brussels, between spring 2017 and autumn 2018.#

### A technical pre-requisite for the recovery of assets

Firstly, the objective was to prevent the appropriation of public assets by members of the ousted leadership and their associates. Because the deposed leaders left office abruptly and practically overnight, they retained access to public funds they could easily, in addition to access to funds misappropriated at an earlier stage. The urgency of the situation made it imperative to freeze the assets immediately, in order to afford some time for the authorities from the affected countries to issue proper international mutual legal assistance requests.

### A political signal of support (and reconciliation)

A separate, if closely related rationale of misappropriation sanctions was to support the new leaderships of Arab Spring. Avoiding the misappropriation of assets that would contribute to the impoverishment of the state. The motivation was clearly political: the asset freezes were applied as a signal of support to the post-revolutionary leaderships of Tunisia and Egypt. #Boogaerts 2018# This goal was of key importance to the EU given that the European response to the protest movements had not been one of support. Prior to the overthrow of the doomed regimes, most European government had been cautious about aligning themselves with the revolutionary forces. The leadership in France infamously offered help to the Tunisian government to repress the revolts. #Chrisafis, A. (2011) „Sarkozy admits France made mistakes over Tunisia“, The Guardian, 24 January 2011, available at: www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/24/nicolas-sarkozy-tunisia-protests# From this point of vantage, the freezing of assets of ousted leaders was not just a step designed to build bridges with a new political elite with which Europeans had no previous links, but partly also a conciliatory gesture to make up for the initial absence of support for the Arab Spring. In fact, European hesitations about backing the popular protests appeared to be at odds with the EU’s declared objective of promoting democracy in its neighbourhood. The situation repeated itself three years later with the Maidan protests in Ukraine, where the freezing of assets by the EU followed a sudden change of government. Due to the similarity between the Arab Spring and the Maidan protest, visible in a pattern of popular unrest leading to the unexpected and abrupt ousting of the leadership, the EU replicated the approach witnessed in the aftermath of the Arab Spring.

The message of support of the assets freeze is not merely a symbolic gesture of solidarity with post-revolutionary forces that seized power. Restoring the frozen assets frozen to the state arches also support the stabilisation of the post-revolutionary situation and of the new government. Recovered funds can be used to aid economic reconstruction. #The Economist (2014) “Ukraine’s stolen assets. A long, hard slog”, 5 March 2014# The new governments will find it more difficult to build legitimacy and to implement reforms with a meagre budget. The Council of the EU framed the adoption of the assets freezes as part of a policy of democracy promotion. The text of the CFSP Decision on Tunisia announced the freezing of assets “against persons responsible for misappropriation of Tunisian state funds and who are thus depriving the Tunisian people of the benefits of the sustainable development of their economy and society and undermining the development of democracy in the country” (author’s emphasis). #Council Decision 2011/72/CFSP of 31 January 2011 concerning restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities in view of the situation in Tunisia, OJ L 28, 2.2.2011, p. 62–64# Similar wording was inserted in the CFSP Decision adopting identical measures with regard to Egypt barely two months later. #Council Decision 2011/172/CFSP of 21 March 2011 concerning restrictive measures directed against certain persons, entities and bodies in view of the situation in Egypt, OJ L 076 22.3.2011, p. 63#

The freezes were temporary and provisional in character, and were put in place with urgency, in the context of quickly evolving circumstances and on the assumption that they would be replaced by an international mutual legal assistance request shortly after.

From the above account, the observer can deduce the following: Firstly, in sharp contrast to the popular belief that sanctions are invariably about changing behaviour, misappropriation sanctions do not pursue the goal of coercing any government or individual to change behaviour. They lack any coercive purpose, which would be inviable given that the targeted individuals are no longer in office. Having fled the country, these individuals no longer form part of the political landscape, therefore, their behaviour has become irrelevant for both the EU and the requesting country. Illustratively, the measure is referred to as “preventive blocking” (French: “blocage preventif”) under Swiss legislation. #Conseil Federal (2016) “Le Conseil fédéral prolonge le blocage de fonds à l’encontre de plusierus personnes provenant de Tunisie, d’Egypte et d’Ukraine”, Information DFAE, 9 December 2016, available at: https://www.eda.admin.ch/countries/rwanda/fr/home/actualite/nouveautes.html/content/eda/fr/meta/news/2016/12/9/64888# Instead, the assets freezes are meant to prevent the flight of misappropriated funds until these can be recovered, and to send a signal of support to the leaderships that replaced the targeted leaders. Therefore, any evaluation of whether sanctions have been successful ought to be conducted with reference to these two sets of objectives.

The freezes have been scarcely successful in attaining the goal of allowing for asset recovery, given that very designees have been indicted. Pending the indictment, the freezes must be renewed year after year. By contrast, the measures have been successful in helping EU member states establishing links with the new leaderships. The new elites report high appreciation for the EU’s continued willingness to keep the assets frozen, which they continue to regard as a gesture of solidarity and support, in particular in the case of Ukraine.

## Explaining the Selectivity of EU Assets Freeze Imposition

Having introduced a practice of freezing assets to aid their recovery, the EU has made a sparse and selective use of this tool, deploying it in some but not all occasions where it was relevant.

The views of EU member states on the effectiveness of assets freezes and their adequacy to address misappropriation is predominantly negative, although divergences in the assessment of these measures by different capitals are observable.
As explained above, the freezes were agreed as temporary measures, in the expectation that they would be replaced by an international mutual legal assistance request shortly after. However, several years on, few designees have been indicted. In some cases, no charges have been made yet. The slow pace at which these cases are proceeding can be explained with the help of several reasons. Firstly, the ownership of funds by members of the former leadership is often difficult to establish, as it might be hidden under front companies. Thus, investigations are often of a protracted nature. Secondly, the judicial systems in post-revolutionary settings are seldom free of political interference. As posited by asset recovery expert Gretta Fenner, “independence of the prosecutor general office is…often not given in countries that still struggle in democratic transition. Prosecution services all around the world, in countries with young democracy or no democracy for a long time, have actively been used as a tool of political power”. #Fenner 2016, p.19# Egyptian and Ukrainian judiciaries perform poorly according to indicators of independence and efficiency of the judicial system produced by the World Bank and the World Economic Forum.

This state of affairs is unsatisfactory from a Brussels viewpoint. The main problem that the Council of the EU has encountered is the scrutiny of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Following the 2008 landmark Kadi ruling, a Saudi citizen residing in Sweden who was successful in challenging his inclusion in the EU’s terrorism list, it has become frequent for blacklisted individuals to challenge their designations. For a number of years, the Council lost a large percentage of the cases brought to Court, which obliged it to drop the designations. #Happold 2016; Portela 2009, 2018a# The requirements of the CJEU to uphold the legality of blacklists have led the Council to seek better substantiation to underpin its designations (see below), improving their solidity. However, it has also compelled the Council to broaden the designation criteria in EU delegation in an attempt to fend off court challenges. In the event, all this managed to reverse the trend. An official from the Council legal service at the Council Secretariat reported: “In 2012, 2013 and 2014 the Council was still losing twice as many cases as it won… In 2015 that trend was reversed; the Council won more than twice as many cases as it lost. The same applies for 2016”. #20 Improvement to the statement of reasons has indeed allowed the Council to uphold designations. This is visible in the few cases of litigation initiated by Tunisian targets: the General Court rejected requests to annul Mehdi Ben Ali’s and Fahed Al Matri’s relisting, and it also rejected the annulment requests of Sirine Ben Ali and Mohamed Mabrouk. #Interview with EU member state representative, Brussels, October 2018#

Despite a positive trend, litigation remain a source of concern for the Council, as rulings favourable to the claimant carry a loss of its credibility and prestige. Prior to the yearly renewal of the measures, additional information and updates are requested from the prosecutors in the respective countries, in an effort to strengthen the justification for the listings. At the same time, little can be done to speed up the processes of investigation and indictment, and EU Member states are reticent about influencing on foreign judicial systems, which are supposed to operate independently from political pressure. This has created a certain uneasiness with a situation in which the Council is responsible for upholding often-fragile designations in front of its own judiciary for an indefinite period, while at the same time, it is not in its power to effect convictions or even speed up the investigation process. Moreover, CJEU requirements oblige the Council to request supporting information from the requesting states regularly – every time that a Court case is decided as well as for the yearly revision of measures – creating a burden especially resented by member states which have not found any misappropriated assets in their jurisdictions.

In the absence of convictions in the requesting country, the de-listing of designees have been motivated by successful court challenges, or a decision by the Council to drop the entry based on the realisation that the evidence available to sustain the listing was too meagre to withstand judicial scrutiny. A third possibility is that the requesting country drops charges, which evidently compels the EU to follow suit and remove the individual from its blacklist. The fragile nature of these sanctions regimes can be read off the decremental dynamics of the blacklists: Existing designations may be dropped, but no new entries are added.

Additional factors contribute to the growing reserve of member states about the use of assets freezes include that the practice of freezing assets to address misappropriation has been criticised by the academic doctrine. Finally, there aware among EU circles that blacklists based on designations are suggested by foreign governments run a risk of abuse. Current leaderships may be tempted to “neutralise” innocent political opponents who are perceived as inconvenient by suggestion to the EU their inclusion in the blacklists.

Altogether, delegates rate the prospects of establishing new sanctions regimes along the lines of the Tunisia, Egypt and Ukraine regimes as low. In the words of one of the interviewees, “these sanctions regimes are unsustainable in the long term”. #Bartels 2014# On top of the severity of the difficulties discussed, a CFSP sanction is not the only framework under which assets can be frozen, which obviates the need to activate this policy tool altogether.

In conclusion, a number of reasons can be deduced from the above said to explain EU selectivity in the application of assets freezes. The freezes where originally adopted as a response to a major foreign policy crisis, the Arab Spring. Because of the atypical nature of the crisis, the EU lacked a blueprint for addressing successful revolutionary revolts. The imposition of an assets freeze was instrumental in establishing an amicable link to the post-revolutionary elites, by meeting one of their first request to the EU and by helping European governments position itself in favour of the new leaderships and against the previous rulers. The Council resorted to the CFSP was not only because it is an instrument often used to freeze assets, about also because the crisis at hand was seen as a foreign policy crisis requiring a foreign policy response. The Maidan crisis replicated this pattern, giving rise to an identical response.

Over time, the adoption of this policy came to be regarded as disappointing, although some variation exists among member states in the level of satisfaction with this set of measures. The main source of unease takes the form of court challenges. Given that designations do not come from its member states, but from the requesting country concerned, the Council has to rely on a third party for the substantiation of listings. This puts the EU in the uncomfortable position of having to request information from the third state in order to be able to uphold its listings, almost inverting the notion of “petitioning state”. The circumstance that the process of indictment and convictions is in the hands of a judicial system subject to political manipulation further complicates the matter: As an external party, the EU lacks the legitimacy to exert influence on a third country’s judiciary, and the means to prevent domestic political interference. Government and civil society but not judicial systems are habitual interlocutors of the EU in its dealings with third countries.

Even though the CFSP includes the rule of law among its objectives, the EU did not regard the freezing of assets in Tunisia, Egypt and Ukraine as a measure to fight corruption in the first instance. The foreign policy rationale evidently prevailed over anti-corruption considerations. This is in consonance with EU sanctions practice: While sanctions have often been applied in response to democratic backsliding in third countries, there is no single case of sanctions imposed to address corruption other than the three misappropriation regimes discussed here. Notably, none of these sanctions pits the EU against a foreign government: Because they concern deposed leaders, they do not carry a political cost to the EU. Rather, they afford the EU the gratitude of the post-revolutionary government, which perceive it a powerful gesture of support. The primarily foreign policy rationale of the misappropriation sanctions regimes represents a reason for its maintenance despite the meagre progress achieved so far: member states see the value of keeping them in place because of the appreciation shown by the requesting governments. Particular importance is given to bilateral relations to this partners given that they are partner countries included in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), a group of countries with which the EU seeks close relations on account of their geographical proximity, which are located in increasingly unstable areas.

## The EU and Swiss Legal Frameworks for Asset Freezing

### The EU

#### Legal Instruments Implementing Asset Freezes

As mentioned at the outset, sanctions are agreed by a unanimous decision of the EU Council. However, to the extent that such decisions require measures that affect the Union’s “economic and financial relations with one or more third countries”, they must further be implemented by a regulation detailing the exact scope of those measures. Sanctions falling within this provision include “restrictive measures - against natural or legal persons and groups”, in particular asset freezes. Because of this dual structure, EU sanctions-based asset freeze measures, such as those related to misappropriation of public funds in third countries, always rest on two separate legal instruments: a Council Decision and a Council Regulation implementing that Decision. The regulations are directly applicable in all EU Member States, meaning that they create legal obligations directly to EU citizens and entities established in the EU, without any need for additional national implementing measures. For instance, any EU financial institution is obligated to implement an asset freeze measure immediately when a regulation enters into force – i.e., at the time it is published in the Official Journal of the European Union.

Each of the misappropriation sanctions regimes of the EU have been established through a different set of legal instruments. Chronologically, the first of these were sanctions related to Tunisia, adopted through by Council Decision 2011/72/CFSP on 31 January 2011, followed closely by those related to Egypt, adopted through Council Decision 2011/172/CFSP on 21 March 2011. Finally, sanctions related to misappropriation in Ukraine were established through Council Decision 2014/199/CFSP on 5 March 2014.
Each Decision was accompanied by a regulation implementing its economic and financial aspects: respectively, Council Regulation (EU) No 101/2011, Council Regulation (EU) No 270/2011, and Council Regulation No (EU) 208/2014. All six legal instruments have been amended several times since their adoption, primarily in order to modify their annexes which contain the lists of persons targeted by the asset freezes, their identification details, and statements of reasons for each person targeted, as well as in certain cases to amend “listing criteria”, i.e. the definition of who can be subjected to the asset freeze measure under a given decision and regulation. Very often such modifications were a reaction to judgements from the European Court of Justice, annulling specific measures due to procedural or other defects, as discussed below.

The substantive provisions of each Regulation are almost identical. For instance, the current regulation related to Ukraine contains the following provisions: Article 1 provides for the definitions used in the Regulation; Article 2 provides for the freezing of assets, and the prohibition on making assets available, to parties listed in an annex; Article 3 describes the criteria under which persons may be added to the annex as well as the information that must be provided for each entry on it; Articles 4 to 7 provide for various grounds on the basis of which national competent authorities may authorise exceptions to the freezing measures as well as other exemptions (such as for funds needed to basic living expenses, to pay for pre-existing debts, legal fees, etc.); Articles 8 and 12 provide for reporting to authorities of assets frozen as well as exchanging such information among the Member States and the European Commission; Article 9 establishes a prohibition on measures intended to circumvent the asset freeze; Articles 10 and 11 provide for limits of liability and protection from claims of EU operators; Articles 13 and 16 require Member States to designate national authorises for the implementation of the Regulations and empower the European Commission to modify contact details of national competent authorities as listed in an annex; Article 14 provides for the procedure for the Council amending the list of persons targeted by the asset freeze, including a requirement to communicate the freezing decision and the ground for listing to the targeted persons as well as to review its decision in case new evidence or observations are presented to the Council; Article 15 requires Member States to adopt domestic laws on penalties for violations of the regulation; Article 17 provides for the personal and territorial application of the Regulation; and, finally, Article 18 provides for the entry into force and direct applicability of the Regulation.

The asset freeze established by such measures requires any person or entity falling within EU jurisdiction to prevent any movement or modification of “funds” or “economic resources” “belonging to, owned, held or controlled by” any person listed on the annex to the relevant regulation as well as to refrain from making any funds or economic resources available to such parties. “Funds” encompasses cash, funds on accounts, and other similarly liquid assets, while “economic resources” are essentially any other tangible or intangible assets that have economic or financial value. The freezing obligation applies to any commercial entities and even private individuals who are in possession or control of relevant assets, or in a position to prevent them being made available. Frozen funds must be reported to domestic authorities. Failing to comply is subject to penalties as established under domestic laws of each Member State. Interestingly, the Regulations do not contain any provisions on the conditions or process of confiscation or restitution of frozen funds to the originating Governments.

#### Case Law and Analysis

EU sanctions measures implementing asset freezes in response to misappropriation of State funds in third countries have been extensively tested in the Court of Justice of the European Union, as have other forms of EU targeted sanctions. At time of writing, the General Court (its first instance) and the Court of Justice (the appellate body) had issued a total of 30 judgments related to the asset freeze regimes on Egypt, Tunisia, and Ukraine. The primary focus of those cases has been claims by those targeted that the asset freeze had violated their substantive or procedural fundamental rights, such as the right to property, rights of the defence, and failure to state reasons, and that the Council had made manifest errors of judgment and misused its powers in ordering the freezes.

This case law, and that related to other EU sanctions, delineates the limits of the EU’s competence in adopting and maintaining asset freezes in the CFSP context as well as procedural requirements in doing so. Prior to the Arab Spring, the EU had never adopted CFSP sanctions in response to misappropriation of State funds. Until then, they were targeted at more traditional security and foreign policy threats: proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, armed conflict, and grave internal repression. One of the questions underlying the early case law was, therefore, whether the imposition of misappropriation sanctions was appropriate under the Common Foreign and Security Policy at all, or whether other mechanism should have been used.

However, the General Court explicitly rejected any such claims, noting on the case of Egypt that the Council adopted the measures to “support the peaceful and orderly transition to a civilian and democratic government in Egypt based on the rule of law, with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms” as part of part of a “policy of supporting the new Egyptian authorities, intended to promote both the economic and political stability in Egypt”. As such, the Court ruled, the measures were “fully based on the CFSP and satisfied” the objectives of EU external action.

Importantly, the Court has affirmed that the act of using the CFSP asset freeze mechanism in relation to third state misappropriation situations is not, in itself, a disproportionate violation of the right to property of those targeted. The Court recalled that under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, such rights may be limited under certain conditions – specifically, limitations are justified to the extent that they are provided for by law, pursue an important general interest of the EU, and are proportional to the general interest being pursued. In the context of misappropriation sanctions, the Court has been satisfied that all three can, in principle, be met.

As for the general interest being pursued, the Court noted that the sanctions in the case of Egypt, by way of example, were ”part of a policy of supporting the new Egyptian authorities, intended to promote both the economic and political stability of Egypt and, in particular, to assist the authorities of that country in their fight against the misappropriation of State funds” which, in turn, was compatible with EU external policy objectives laid down in the Treaty, including the aim to “consolidate and support democracy, the rule of law, human rights and the principles of international law”.

As for the proportionality of the asset freeze in relation to that objective, the Court has emphasised that “respect for the rule of law is one of the primary values on which the European Union is founded” and therefore a weighty objective. At the same time, the Court hilghlighted that not all acts of misappropriation of public funds in third countries would be serious enough to be capable of undermining the rule of law to the extent that a CFSP asset freeze, and the resulting infringement of the right to property, would be a justified and proportionate measure. For an (alleged) act to qualify, the Court reasoned, it would have to be serious enough “having regard to the amount or the type of funds or assets misappropriated or to the context in which the offence took place” so that it could “undermine the legal and institutional foundations of [the country in question] and in particular the principles of legality, prohibition of arbitrary exercise of power by the executive, effective judicial review and equality before the law and, ultimately, to undermine respect for the rule of law in that country”. But within such context, the General Court ruled, the asset freeze measure would be proportional. On appeal, the Court of Justice further confirmed that an asset freeze could be justified also against a person subject to merely a pre-trial investigation for such acts, since “the effectiveness of a decision to freeze funds would be undermined if the adoption of restrictive measures were made subject to the criminal convictions of persons suspected of having misappropriated funds, since those persons would have enough time pending their conviction to transfer their assets”.

As for being “provided for by law”, the Court has noted the activities of which the targeted person is accused must strictly fall within the stated objective of the measure, i.e. constitute “misappropriation”. To establish the scope of the term, undefined in all of the regulations, the Court has relied on an EU Directive related to financial crime, which defines it as “the action of a public official who is directly or indirectly entrusted with the management of funds or assets to commit or disburse funds or appropriate or use assets contrary to the purpose for which they were intended in any way which damages the Union’s financial interests”. In this vein, the Court noted that a person accused of having engaged in cross-border money-laundering operations from Tunisia could not legally be subjected to an asset freeze on this basis, since, while unlawful in Tunisia, it did not constitute “misappropriation”. If, however, the alleged activity indeed does squarely fall within that definition, the Court has accepted that also this “provided by law” requirement is satisfied in EU’s misappropriation sanctions and that, therefore, they do not in themselves constitute an illegal violation of the right to property.
In other words, the EU Courts have confirmed that freezing assets to counter misappropriation of third State funds is within the acceptable remit of the asset freeze tool in the EU Common and Foreign Security policy toolkit. However, the Court has also emphasised that any such measure must not only satisfy the proportionality described test above, but also a set of other, mostly procedural requirements.

According to established case law from the EU Courts, a decision to impose an asset freeze on any individual or entity must be based on a “solid factual basis”, as evidenced by information in the Council’s file. In a series of cases ruled on by the Court in late 2015 and early 2016, former Ukrainian officials subject to an asset freeze claimed that no such basis existed for the measures to which they had been subjected. When requested, the Council was only able to produce as evidence of the factual basis of the measures a letter from the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Ukraine to the EU’s foreign policy chief, listing the individuals in question and stating that “Ukrainian law enforcement authorities have initiated a number of criminal proceedings to investigate criminal acts committed” by the senior officials listed, and that “that the inquiry in question made it possible to establish misappropriation of sizeable amounts of State funds and the subsequent illegal transfer of those funds outside Ukraine”, without adding further detail.  The Court noted that the letter was so vague that the Council had not been able to shown evidence indicating that it had “any information regarding the acts or conduct specifically imputed to the [persons in question],” even when taking into account the commonly known “context” of the letter, i.e. the developments in Ukraine.

To shield the freezing measures related to Ukraine from successful challenges, the Council has taken a number of steps to build up the underlying evidence, broaden the criteria for listing the targeted persons, and elaborate on individual statements of reasons. In September 2016, the General Court issued its judgement on the case brought against the Council by Viktor Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine. As with so many earlier cases, the Court noted that the vague letter from Ukrainian prosecutors was not specific enough to justify an EU asset freeze, and went on to annul the original asset freeze against Mr Yanukovych.

However, the Court then pointed out that the Council had, since the initial freeze, modified the underlying legal instruments by adopting a modified statement of reasons for the listing of Mr Yanukovych in 2015 and had provided, as evidence underlying that new decision, a new letter from the Ukrainian Prosecutors, received in October 2014. In this letter, the Court pointed out, the authorities had described in detail “three pre-trial investigations within the framework of criminal proceedings initiated with respect to the applicant in relation to acts classifiable as misappropriation of public funds [concerning] (i) misappropriation of assets while acting in concert with others as part of the illegal funding of construction of a telecommunications network; (ii) misappropriation of buildings, facilities and land, together with other public properties and the legalisation of ill-gotten gains, and (iii) misappropriation of a plot of land”. The Court was satisfied that this provided sufficient proof of the solid basis for the adoption of the measure and its statement of reasons (i.e. that Mr Yanukovych was “was the subject of criminal proceedings for misappropriation of public funds or assets” in Ukraine).
Mr Yanukovych’s appeal was later rejected by the Court of Justice, which confirmed that the “the detailed nature of the charges brought against the appellant, as set out in [the 2015 letter]” established an appropriate factual basis for the asset freeze, in the absence of contradicting exculpatory evidence produced by Mr Yanukovych. It should be noted in later case law the Court has required, in cases where such contrary evidence plausibly challenges the reliability of the Council’s position, the Council must investigate further to determine the continued justification of the measure.
In summary, the European Union, acting under the Common Foreign and Security Policy by a unanimous decision of Member States, may choose to adopt misappropriation related asset freezes related against individuals in third countries if

- the activities can be categorised as “misappropriation”, i.e. as “a public official who is directly or indirectly entrusted with the management of funds or assets” using, disbursing, or appropriating those funds contrary to the purpose to which they were intended;

- the activities are serious enough to be capable of undermining the rule of law in that third country; and

- the measures are based on solid factual basis, indicating, for each targeted person, at least the existence of an investigation into activities satisfying (i) and (ii).

On the whole, the evolution of the misappropriation sanctions case law closely resembles that of the more traditional sanctions on terrorism and on third countries. In other words, the Courts initially acknowledged that the Council had not overstepped its CFSP discretion or human rights boundaries by ordering asset freezes on individuals, but still annulled a series of listing in the absence of any reliable evidence to support the stated reasons. Then, after people were listed with stronger evidence, the Court seemed ready to defer to the Council on their adequacy, as long as they were not evidently insufficient. Similar treatment was afforded also to the listing criteria.

### Switzerland

#### Constitutional Basis

In Switzerland, the constitutional basis for assets freezes related to the potential misappropriation of State funds by officials in third countries is established by Article 54(1) of the Federal Constitution. Freezing ordinances, which resemble the EU freezing regulations, are today issued on the basis of the Constitution and a subordinate regulation, the Federal Act on the Freezing and the Restitution of Illicit Assets held by Foreign Politically Exposed Persons (Foreign Illicit Assets Act, FIAA), adopted in 2016. In contrast to the EU, where misappropriation related assets freezes are adopted under the Common Foreign and Security Policy, like any other sanctions against third states, the Swiss legal basis is separate from that authorising the Federal Council to adopt sanctions related to international peace and security, i.e. the Federal Act on the Implementation of International Sanctions (Embargo Act, EmbA).

#### Legal Instruments Implementing Asset Freezes

The Foreign Illicit Assets Act, divided into nine sections, contains most of the substantial provisions applicable to asset freeze regimes adopted though individual ordinances.
Section 1 describes the purpose of the act and definitions used in it. Section 2 lays down three separate basis for an asset freeze, permitting this

- in order to support future cooperation within the framework of mutual legal assistance proceedings with the country of origin, in circumstances where there is a change of power in the country and a corrupt Government has, or is certain to, fall;

- where assets have already been made subject to a provisional seizure order within the framework of international legal assistance proceedings, but the third country is unable to satisfy the requirements for mutual legal assistance due to a structural failure of its judicial system; and

- where a request for mutual legal assistance has been received from a third country, but that country is unable to meet basic procedural requirements for such co-operation laid down in Swiss law.

Section 2 also provides for the procedure of adopting the lists of persons targeted by the freezes, the duration of measures, the obligation on persons and entities subject to Swiss jurisdiction to report of assets frozen, administration of such assets, the basis of which national competent authorities may authorize exception to the freezing measures, and “amicable settlement” for the restitution of assets.  Section 3 provides for measures Swiss authorities may take in order to facilitate the restitution of the funds to the originating State, including through technical assistance and information sharing.
Section 4 provides for the conditions of confiscating assets that have been frozen, including when assets may be presumed to have been of illicit origin, and for protection of the rights of third parties. Section 5 lays down the procedure for the restitution of the assets frozen and confiscated to the originating State. Section 6 provides for the procedural rights of those that have been targeted by freezing measures.

Sections 7 covers aspects related to information exchange within the Swiss Government, data processing, and reporting to Parliament. Section 8 lays down penalties for violations of the Act, including the asset freeze and reporting obligations, as well as certain jurisdictional and procedural aspects related to resulting judicial proceedings. Finally, Section 9 contains provisions related to the entry into force, transitional periods, and other similar aspects of the law itself.
The targets of asset freezes are established through ordinances, adopted in relation to specific third countries in situations that satisfy on of the three criteria listed the Foreign Illicit Assets Act. At the time of writing, Switzerland maintains two ordinances based on the Foreign Illicit Assets Act: the Ordinance blocking assets in the context of Tunisia (Ordinance 196.127.58) and the Ordinance blocking assets in the context of Ukraine (Ordinance 196.127.67). A former ordinance adopted in relation to the situation in Egypt (Ordinance 946.231.132.1) has been revoked. The ordinances are annexed with lists of persons targeted by the asset freeze.

#### Case Law and Analysis

In Switzerland, the Federal Administrative Court has been invited to contemplate on the three misappropriation ordinances on a handful of occasions. Unsurprisingly, the cases brought by persons targeted by asset freezes have rested on similar arguments as in the EU case law – in particular, the infringement of the right to property and violation of the principle of proportionality. The Court in Switzerland has accepted that, as such, the freezing of assets does indeed infringe the right property, but noted (much like its EU counterpart) that such rights may be restricted under certain conditions: (i) the restriction must be based on law; (ii) it must be justified by public interest or the protection of rights of others; (iii) and it must be proportional, in other words limited to what is necessary and adequate to obtain the justified interest pursued.

The Court has also arrived at similar conclusions as the one in the EU. The interest being pursued by the measures was a legitimate interest protected by the Constitution, the Court determined, in particular protecting the financial system and reputation of Switzerland as well as furthering sustainable development and the fight against impunity, in particular where the targeted person is unquestionably closely associated with the regime of the third country. Further, the Court ruled that it is also necessary for that aim to adopt an all-encompassing asset freeze (rather than e.g. identifying specific assets that have been misappropriated), since assets could otherwise be moved beyond Switzerland’s reach before the third country authorities had time to conclude their investigations. Consequently, a measure such as the asset freeze in the context of Egypt on persons closely associated with the regime satisfied the constitutional principle of proportionality.

The Court has further ruled that a measure against any individual has to strictly satisfy the four cumulative conditions laid down in Article 3(1)(2) of the FIAA, i.e. that (a) the Government or its members have, or are about to, lose power, (b) the level of corruption in the country is notoriously high, (c) that it appears likely that the assets have been acquired through corruption, criminal mismanagement, or other felonies, and (d) that the safeguarding of Swiss interests require the freeze.
Of these, points (a), (b) and (d) are concerned with the gravity of overall circumstances in the third country and their impact on Switzerland. In a case relating to the context of Ukraine, the Court reaffirmed its position that Switzerland’s interests are inherently jeopardised should it permit assets misappropriated from third countries to flow through its financial system. It also accepted on the basis of publicly available information, such as NGO reports, that corruption in Ukraine was widely spread, and that the President had lost power – accepting, therefore, that points (a), (b) and (d) were satisfied and implicitly accepting that the situation in Ukraine, in general, was such that the imposition of asset freezes on the basis of Foreign Illicit Assets Act could be justified.

However, it would additionally have to be established, the Court stated, the assets frozen were likely to have been obtained through misappropriation or similar illicit means. Noting that the law was silent on the level of probability that should be associated with this criterion, the Court accepted that the threshold should initially be low, in order to protect the effectiveness of the measures. Given the information provided to the Court by the administration, including a letter from the Ukrainian authorities, indicated that the relevant person appeared to have been engaged in systematic illegal enrichment, the Court ruled that there was a high probability that a given asset had, indeed, been illegally obtained – without actually tracing any specific illegal activity to the specific asset. In other words, starting from a very different place, the Court reached a similar requirement as the EU Court: for an asset freeze against a specific person be justified, there has to be reliable information suggesting that the target has, personally, been involved in misappropriation or benefited from it.

Article 1 of the Foreign Illicit Assets Act adds one final criterion for an individual asset freeze to be justified, i.e. that the targeted person must be a “foreign politically exposed person” (PEP), which includes high level politicians and officials from different branches of Government, as well as their close associates. While EU misappropriation regulations do not explicitly contain any such requirement, it should be noted that under the definition adopted by the EU Court, only “a public official who is directly or indirectly entrusted with the management of funds or assets” can in fact engage in “misappropriation”. Given that the listing criteria under these regulations typically include also “natural or legal persons, entities or bodies associated” with persons suspected of misappropriation, it appears that the scope of the Swiss and EU measures are very similar.

## Comparing the EU and Swiss Legal Frameworks

In terms of enabling the freeze of assets belonging to persons suspected of misappropriation or their close associates, the legal frameworks of the EU and Switzerland appear, on the regulatory level, to be largely comparable. Both enable the authorities to impose freezing measures after determining on a credible basis that there is reason to believe that corrupt officials are likely to have engaged in mismanagement of State funds, assuming the circumstances taken as a whole are grave enough to warrant such robust response.

While, at least in some cases, the measures in both jurisdictions have rested at least partially on documentation provided by prosecutors or other authorities in the third state, neither jurisdiction explicitly provides the sources from which the evidence or information underlying the measures must originate. It may be, however, that in practice the EU Council is bound to be more reliant on information originating from the third state, as it inherently lacks investigatory powers and resources as well as subordinate agencies designed to obtain evidence. The Swiss Federal Council, on the other hand, can presumably more effortlessly rely on the law enforcement and other agencies in the executive branch.

Perhaps the most important distinction, however, is that the Swiss legislation seems to much more comprehensively address the various stages necessary in the recovery of assets to the relevant third state. Within the EU misappropriation sanctions framework, regulations speak exclusively to the freezing of assets identified as being owned, held, or controlled by targeted individuals. The exceptions and authorisations related to the release of frozen funds do not - at least explicitly - provide a basis of confiscating those assets or for their restitution to the appropriate authorities in the third state. This is bound to cause difficulties in the later stages of the recovery process. Conversely, Swiss legislation explicitly provides a legal basis for not only freezing, but also for confiscation and restitution, thereby offering a more mature basis for the recovery process as a whole.

## Evaluating the Effectiveness of Freezes

Having reviewed the overall political and legal framework of EU asset freezes, we now turn to analyses the use of misappropriation sanctions on Tunisia, Egypt and Ukraine with a view to ascertaining their effectiveness. In addition to evaluating the cases with reference to the aims stipulated in relevant EU documents, the present section pays attention to the following set of questions:

- Which individuals were included in and removed from the blacklists, and why?
- Have the asset freezes ultimately facilitated/paved the way for asset recovery?
- What obstacles are preventing asset recovery? How successful have the requesting countries been in recovering assets at the national level?
- Have the blacklists had any impacts on designees/ imposing countries beyond the key goal of facilitating asset recovery?

### Ukraine

Despite the fact that the Ukrainian blacklist is chronologically the last one adopted, it constitutes our first case study because of its unusual complexity. Sanctions were adopted in two rounds (March and April 2014), separated by merely five weeks. According to expert Gretta Fenner, “European jurisdictions acted as fast as they ever have”, probably thanks to the fact that they closely followed the Arab Spring blueprint. The table below helps the visualisation of the designations under the EU misappropriation sanctions regimes. Individuals were blacklisted at the request of the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine. All of them filed cases in front of the CJEU. Some of them did win their cases and got their designations annulled. Sometimes the EU were removed entries from the blacklists while the cases were still being considered in the Court, delisting individuals listed on tenuous grounds before the Court issued its ruling, as in the case of Andriy Portnov. In other cases, such as Sergiy Kliuiev, Ukraine dropped the listing and the EU automatically did likewise. Finally, the Court has also upheld some designations. In the recent ruling on Andriy Klyuyev, the Court annulled the original designation but upheld the legality of its renewal, which reflects an evolution in which the EU has gradually improved the evidentiary basis for the designations.

The asset freezes have not yet been successful in facilitating asset recovery; however, the freezes have been in place for a relatively short time – less than five years. While the EU does not publish information on the amounts frozen – the European Commission collects it, but it is not authorised to disclose them, Ukrainian authorities reported freezes totalling 107,2 million USD, 15,9 million EUR and 135,0 million CHF in Austria, UK, Latvia, Cyprus, Italy, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Netherlands. As pointed out by Michael Howard, not a single Ukrainian political or businessman implicated in the Yanukovych corruption ear has been brought to justice. The obstacles preventing asset recovery have been identified as follows: Firstly, the funds and their ownership are difficult to trace, and the Prosecutor General Office has little experience with financial investigations. However, the most significant problem is the persistence of political interference in the Office’s work, as well as the disincentives this creates for officials. These are often reluctant to move cases forward for fear of retribution. In the words of Gretta Fenner, Office members investigate “people who are still very powerful and have resources at their disposal to destroy you if they want to…If you are successful in your work, you expose yourself to risks”. The mismatch between the EU and the Ukrainian blacklists can be seen as evidence of political interference: Some of the names submitted to the EU for listing, such as Pshonka and Zacharchenko, do not feature on the Ukrainian blacklist. In addition, on the basis of her experience as an advisor to the Ukrainian Office of the Prosecutor general, the same expert points to an initial lack of understanding of the centrality of domestic prosecutions to the success of assets recovery by Ukrainian actors.

Nevertheless, the blacklists are considered political useful beyond their performance in paving the way for asset recovery. EU members consider the misappropriation sanctions part of a broader package of sanctions imposed in response to Russian interference in Ukraine. Although formally separate and associated to different objectives, they are linked to the Crimea embargo and the sanctions addressing destabilisation of Eastern Ukraine. From this point of view, the freezes form part of a broader response to Russian interference in sovereign states, in which the EU presents itself as a united front resolutely opposed to such actions. The political significance of the measures is of central importance particularly to member states located in Russia’s vicinity, and which remain willing to uphold the freezes as a gesture of solidarity with Ukraine.

Due to its complexity, the Ukrainian sanctions regime lends itself for a comparison with the equivalent Swiss legislation. Similarly to the EU list, there were two consecutive rounds of freezing; however, the first round preceded the first round of CFSP sanctions, and the second round followed barely three weeks on. However, the faster pace of adoption of freezes in Switzerland should not automatically be seen as evidence of higher efficiency. Because the EU is a composite actor, it generally takes time for the Council to decide on legislation. In addition, the requirement to translate legislation into all EU official languages further slows the process. Similarities in the identity of designees are observable, even though the number of entries is higher in the Swiss list: The 20 initial entries of the Swiss list become 29 in the second round, while the EU blacklisting 19 in the second round and added only three more entries in the second.

### Tunisia

Chronologically the first sanctions regime addressing misapplication, it is features the longest blacklist, including 48 individuals. As evident from the table below, the Tunisian misappropriation regime displays a pattern of stability that contrasts with the dynamics witnessed in the Ukrainian case. Patterns of litigation are the lowest in our sample: only 15 per cent of Tunisian targets contested their designations in court.  The Tunisian case has recorded the greatest progress so far: a limited number of physical assets (an airplane and two yachts) were quickly recovered.

### Egypt

The Egyptian blacklist is the shortest in our sample, featuring only 19 entries. Similar to the Tunisian list, it displays a pattern of continuity along subsequent renewals. Around 55 per cent of Egyptian targets challenged their designations in court.

## The “non-case” of Uzbekistan

The case of Uzbekistan represents an example of exposure and dismantlement of a grand corruption network, and promising case for assets recovery efforts. Interestingly, this case is characterised by the absence of any EU or UN action and Libya. However, there is little ground to believe that this example can be replicated. Asset recovery efforts are being facilitated by several factors. Firstly, a case was filed against Gulnara Karimova in Uzbekistan, leading to her current house arrest. This was due to the domestic political and corruption landscape of Uzbekistan, where state-organised crime is fractured between rival syndicates. As explained by corruption expert Lasslett and his collaborators, the Karimova syndicate was “expropriated and consumed by rivals who have now secured positions of dominance in the Uzbek state after the death of Islam Karimov”. In other words, here, domestic judicial system was very effective, albeit not for the right reasons. Secondly, the dangers and risks involved in operating a grand-corruption via the state machinery compelled the actors involved to rely on offshore jurisdictions to enhance secrecy and security. The presence of transactions through entities located in offshore jurisdictions, coupled with the implication of these entities in a range of criminal activities made it possible for Western authorities to intervene. Thanks to the criminal nature of these actions, the concerned jurisdiction initiated investigations, without resorting to the EU level or receiving an international mutual assistance request.

At the same time, the Uzbek illustrates why the EU has not deployed any asset freezes at all. There was no international crisis associated to either the replacement of Karimov at the head of the Uzbek leadership, nor around the exposure of Karimova’s network. Moreover, In other words, a grand corruption scandal, irrespective of its magnitude, is unlikely to attract the attention of member states foreign office unless it is associated with an international crisis. In its absence, the matter will be quietly left to the law enforcement and judicial agencies.

## Evaluation: CFSP Assets Freezes as effective anti-corruption instruments?

The employment of CFSP assets freezes to advance asset recovery has proved unsatisfactory at EU level and it is unlikely to be repeated in the near future. Reluctance to activate this tool is due to difficulties of legal nature. Such difficulties do not concern the suitability of the CFSP to address misappropriation, which is uncontroversial. On the contrary, the CJEU has acknowledged these measures as part of a policy of supporting new authorities, intended to promote both the economic and political stability of the requesting country and to assist the authorities of that country in their fight against the misappropriation of State funds. This fits the EU external policy of consolidating democracy and the rule of law. The Court has merely set limits on the qualification of misappropriation of public funds in third countries as threatening the rule of law. The Court reasoned that a CFSP measure would only be appropriate if it misappropriation jeopardises the legal and institutional foundations of the country in question. Instead, the key difficulty emanates from the vulnerability of designations to court challenges by designated individuals, in particular since the CJEU established that it was not admissible to freeze assets of individuals who were merely under investigation by the requesting state’s prosecutor general. This problem affects the entire blacklisting practice of the EU. However, what is unique to the misappropriation sanctions is that the listings do not come from EU member states, but from requesting states that do not back them up with sufficient evidence. Therefore, member states find themselves upholding designations of individuals not yet convicted in their home countries, and lacking sufficient information to back them up. This leaves the Council with few resources to fend off annulments by the Court of Justice, which carry a loss of prestige for the institution. This situation contrasts sharply with the blacklisting practices under regular CFSP regimes, where designations are proposed by member states, and the Council engages in listing and de-listing of entries disconnected from external processes.

In the face of the unsatisfactory state of affairs, how could existing mechanisms be optimised, or replaced with less problematic options? Several alternatives could be contemplated. One of them consists in replicating the Swiss legislative framework in force since 2016. The comparative strengths of the Swiss legislation that are already apparent on the textual level of the regulations/case law. Essentially, this is visible in the fact that the Swiss law addresses also confiscation and restitution, whereas the EU regulations do not. In addition, the Council of Ministers is poorly suited for autonomously obtaining evidence and information, as it relies merely on the capabilities of member states’ foreign offices. This approach would also have the merit of removing the assets freeze from the realm of foreign policy. Its current character as a foreign policy measures prevents its use to address situations of misappropriation which are disconnect from international crises, notably revolutionary regime change. Instead, legislation enabling the adoption of EU-wide asset freezes addressing misappropriation could be moved to the framework of Justice and Home Affairs, an EU policy domain with a growing external dimension.

Another way in which this could be accomplished is by creating a horizontal sanctions list, defined as sanctions legislation devoted to address breaches in a particular field, rather than linked to a specific country. This would not differ substantially from the current approach, given that the operative paragraphs of the three existing regimes are almost identical. This would fit the current trend towards theme-based sanctions lists that follow the model of anti-terrorism lists. Horizontal sanctions regimes to address cybercrime and the use of chemical weapons have already been established, and legislation allowing to blacklist perpetrators of grave human rights breaches is currently under discussion.

Another possible modification to the current system could consist in the insertion of conditional deadlines for the renewal of measures, again following the Swiss legislation. The current CFSP sanctions system foresees the yearly renewal of measures; however, there is no explicit conditional aspect to it. By contrast, Swiss legislation stipulates that the extension of the original listings “is expected to yield tangible progress in pending proceedings”, and that Bern will “decide whether the freezes on these assets will be prolonged on the basis of the progress made in the respective legal proceedings”. The adoption of such conditionality component would provide an unequivocal incentive for requesting states to make progress with their investigations lest the frozen funds be released.

Finally, another option to be contemplated consists in replacing the EU-wide CFSP assets freeze with national assets freezes in those countries where assets have been identified. An EU-wide freeze becomes redundant once it becomes known in which constituencies the funds are located. Removing the CFSP freeze would make eliminate the possibly of challenges in the CJEU; instead, national courts would be competent. It would also release those member states where no misappropriated assets exists from the responsibility of ensuring the proper substantiation for listings, thereby mitigating their reluctance to effect assets freezes when unexpected circumstances so require.
