The Jasmine Revolution that broke out in Tunisia in December 2011 eventually led to the end of a 23-year-long reign of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and started what became known as the Arab Spring.

Together with 48 individuals, mostly part of his extended family network, Ben Ali has been accused by the Tunisian authorities of having illegally acquired assets and sanctions have been applied by the EU. It is believed that Ben Aliâ€™s family has hidden as much as US $17 billion in bank accounts across the world.
