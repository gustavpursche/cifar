The former Air Force officer, Hosni Mubarak, was sworn into power in 1981, after 
the assassination of a former president Anwar Sadat. 
But during the 30 year-long reign, Mubarak, his family and his close circle of 
advisers have enriched themselves through partnerships in powerful Egyptian 
companies and stashed a lot of this wealth abroad. The exposure of Mubarak's 
wealth by media, which has been assessed by some as high as $70 billion was a 
catalyst for people in Egypt, that time experiencing a chronic lack of jobs, who 
took to streets and pressured Mubarak to step down.  
Hosni Mubarak and his sons Gamal and Alaa Mubarak served three to four-year jail 
sentences on charges of embezzlement and were ordered to pay a $17.5 million 
fine. In March 2017, Hosni Mubarak was released from detention after being 
acquitted of charges of killing protesters but remains under investigation for 
alleged corruption. Mubarak is said to reside in his private family residence in 
Cairo’s upscale district of Heliopolis.
