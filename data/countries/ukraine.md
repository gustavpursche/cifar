The use of brutal force against protesters of the Maidan revolution by president Yanukovych and his government, together with the misuse of power and pressure on independent press and political opponents, all contributed towards the ousting of the president and his allies.

Suspected forms of embezzlement common in the Yanukovych era included theft, corrupt award of projects, rigged energy prices and the misuse of carbon-emissions allowances. It is believed the “the Family” - Yanukovych and his associates - embezzled as much as to US $37 billion by moving state to offshore accounts and companies they controlled. EU sanctions have been in place since 2014.
