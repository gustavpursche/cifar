Azarov held several public posts before becoming the Prime Minister of Ukraine 
in March 2010. He was the Prime Minister until 27 January 2014, when he resigned 
after weeks of Euromaidan protests. During his term as the Prime Minister of 
Ukraine, he is suspected as having been involved in the theft of public funds. 
Azarov is currently residing in Russia.
