The former pilot, Hosni Mubarak, was sworn into power in 1981, after the assassination of a former president Anwar Sadat. But during the 30 year-long reign, Mubarak, his family and his close circle of advisers have enriched themselves through partnerships in powerful Egyptian companies and stashed a lot of this wealth abroad. The exposure of Mubarak's wealth by media, which has been assessed by some as high as $70 billion was a catalyst for people in Egypt, that time experiencing a chronic lack of jobs, who took to streets and pressured Mubarak to step down.  

Several court trials were held against the family, when finally, in May 21 2014 'Hosni Mubarak and his sons Gamal and Alaa Mubarak received three and four-year jail sentences on charges of embezzlement. They were also charged a $17.5 million fine.
