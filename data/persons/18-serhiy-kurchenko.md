story: >-
  Dubbed as the ‘billionaire from nowhere’ or the ‘wizard of gas’, young
  entrepreneur Kurchenko managed to aquire a great wealth in a very short amount
  of time in the gas business. Kurchenko was the head of "The VETEK Group of
  Companies”,  which later included the UMH group that controlled 50 Ukrainian
  and Russian Internet, radio and media brands. Among them: the Ukrainian
  edition of Forbes. Kurchenko’s company UMH has been the publisher of Forbes
  Ukraine until July 2015 when the U.S. government imposed sanctions on him and
  he was denied to use the Forbes brand. He is allegedly residing in Russia,
  where he has acquired real estate and continues to engage in entrepreneurial
  activity.
