## Introduction

Public discourse tends to consider sanctions as a tool of security policy, often overlooking the existence of sanctions imposed to address the misappropriation of state assets. Media reporting on the current EU sanctions regime on Russia/Ukraine highlights the sanctions regimes affecting Russian targets for their support of destabilisation in Eastern Ukraine, as well as the embargo on Crimea. However, the existence of a sanctions regime freezing the assets misappropriated by members of the political elite ousted in the spring of 2014 hardly receives any attention.

Yet, while the EU has been imposing sanctions for decades under its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), the use of sanctions to address misappropriation of state assets represents a novel application of this tool. It emerged in response to the Arab uprisings of 2011, and it was employed again in the aftermath of regime change in Ukraine. However, after the Maidan crisis, the EU has not applied assets freezes elsewhere. These cases are unique in the context of CFSP sanctions policy, as they constitute the only instances in which sanctions applied to leaders who have been deposed rather than in office, and the only assets freezes unaccompanied by visa bans.

After a life span of roughly four to seven years, the application of asset freezes under the CFSP to address cases of misappropriation does not boast a satisfactory record. The freezes have run into trouble: Following the initial freezing, the lack of criminal convictions of the individuals by their country’s judicial systems has not allowed moving ahead with asset recovery. In addition, some of the targets have successfully challenged their designation in front of EU courts, which have annulled their listing due to insufficient evidence. The EU’s inability to maintain the freezing of assets swiftly effected after the ousting of the governments of Tunisia, Egypt and Ukraine has been mournfully described as a “short-term success but a long-term failure”.

In light of this suboptimal state of affairs, the project aims to investigate the following questions with regards to the misappropriation sanctions:

1. Whether CFSP sanctions have proved effective in combatting misappropriation of state assets;
2. Which obstacles impede or limit the effectiveness of these sanctions as a tool for asset recovery; and
3. How does the use of misappropriation sanctions compare to alternative tools for asset recovery. This question will focus on the possible complementarity of or competition with available tools.

Ultimately, the objective of the study is to generate knowledge that can inform the actions of civil society organisations and policy experts active in the field. Currently, such knowledge is unavailable. Existing research cannot be relied upon for this purpose: Scholarship has produced some studies on the impact of blacklists on individuals. However, such research has focused on the measures’ impacts on the behaviour of designees or on the political dynamics in the country affected rather than on their ability to facilitate asset recovery. Thus, a misappropriation angle is missing. The proposed study aims to address this gap, focusing on the EU’s experience.

The present investigation proceeds as follows. First, it outlines the EU’s use of assets freezes to address misappropriation of state funds, identifying their aims and evaluating their efficacy. Secondly, based on the information available, it attempts an explanation of the selectivity with which this tool has been employed so far: it entails only three cases, all of which occurred in the period from 2011 to 2014. The following section will delve into the characteristics of existing EU legislation, performing an analysis of the legal instrument at hand and comparing it to the Swiss legislative model addressing the same issue. This will be followed by case studies exploring the three instances of application of asset freezes: Tunisia, Egypt and Ukraine. After that, a brief look is taken at the asset recovery efforts in Uzbekistan, where no CFSP measures were applied and at the UN assets freezes in Libya for comparative purposes. To conclude, a final section looks at the “big picture”, conducting a global evaluation and presenting the overall findings, providing a response to the opening questions.

## Asset freezes as CFSP Sanctions

Before analysing the EU´s employment of asset freezes to address the misappropriation of state funds, it is necessary to outline the decision-making environment in which such decisions are framed, and contextualise it within EU external governance. The assets freezes were agreed under the foreign policy coordination framework of the EU, the CFSP. Given that the CFSP is an intergovernmental forum, each member state has one vote and decisions must be adopted by unanimity. Therefore, each member state has formally a veto. CFSP sanctions are adopted in pursuance of the objectives of the EU’s external action as stipulated in art 21(2) of the Treaty on European Union, which include, among others, to consolidate and support democracy, the rule of law, human rights and international law, as well as to foster the sustainable economic, social and environmental development of developing countries.

The trigger for the adoption of sanctions comes from the geographical working group dealing with the country concerned. A member state must present the proposal, albeit it may also the tabled by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR). Ultimately, though, all member states must agree to it, given that the decision-making method remains consensus. A request by a third country is only discussed if a member state or the HR asks for its inclusion in the agenda. Nothing precludes any of the member states from proposing an assets freeze in a third country in the absence of an explicit request. Indeed, in CFSP sanctions practice, the proposal of sanctions regimes at the request of third country are very much the exception rather than the norm.

The decision-making procedure consists of two steps. A ‘Council Decision’ is first adopted under Title V of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). This act represents the political decision to wield sanctions. Because of their bearing on the single market, economic and financial measures must then be implemented by the EU rather than the member states. Accordingly, they require the adoption of a regulation under the so-called first pillar, which gives effect to the bans reflected in the previous act. Because decisions affecting the common market must be adopted under a different legal framework, namely a Regulation under qualified majority voting (QMV) follows the CFSP measure. The current legal basis is Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which explicitly provides for the adoption of sanctions against third countries as well as individuals, groups and non-state entities. It reads:

1. “Where a decision, adopted in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title V of the Treaty on European Union, provides for the interruption or reduction, in part or completely, of economic and financial relations with one or more third countries, the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a joint proposal from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Commission, shall adopt the necessary measures. It shall inform the European Parliament thereof.”

2. “Where a decision adopted in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title V of the Treaty on European Union so provides, the Council may adopt restrictive measures under the procedure referred to in paragraph 1 against natural or legal persons and groups or non-State entities.”

Once sanctions are enacted, they are subjected to periodic renewal, normally every twelve months. Renewals take the form of Council Decisions and must again be agreed upon by unanimity. Under the current treaty, the Court of the Justice of European Union (CJEU) has limited powers in the CFSP. However, sanctions imposed against individuals are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court, which established in 2008 that it is competent to review the conformity of CFSP designations with fundamental rights. As a result, sanctions regulations must provide adequate safeguards to protect the fundamental rights of those affected by the measures.

As a general foreign policy legislative framework lacking any specific-misappropriation or anti-corruption dimension, there are no elements permitting any follow up to the initial freeze. There are no provisions for efforts leading to the confiscation and return of the assets at EU level, which means that any action for asset recovery must take place at the level of the individual member states concerned.

## The Use and Efficacy of Assets Freezes for Asset Recovery by the EU

Sanctions are generally believed to be geared towards achieving a change of behaviour in the target. However, scholarship has long recognised that sanctions success should not be measured just in terms of their contribution to the achievement of a change of behaviour in the targeted leadership. Sanctions fulfil a number of functions beyond forcing compliance, and they can be evaluated with reference to the various roles they play. Various authors have pointed to a myriad of roles played by sanctions other than coercion. They can limit the military or economic capacity of the target, thereby preventing them from pursuing policies opposed by the sender of sanctions. They may also deter third countries from following a similar course. They can be used to support or protect activists or political opponents exposed to state repression. Imposing sanctions can also improve the image and electoral prospects of the leaders who advocate them. Importantly, they can be employed to position international actors strategically in the context of an international dispute. The differentiated evaluation of multiple goals is gradually establishing itself in sanctions research. The success or failure of sanctions can only be evaluated against their goals. In order to assess the efficacy of the measures, their objectives must be first ascertained.

Misappropriation sanctions are sanctions regimes that differ fundamentally from the rest of CFSP sanctions. They are accordingly treated as special cases by EU authorities. From the perspective of EU member states, standard CFSP sanctions are meant to compel the target to change course, and deter specific forms of behaviour. Yet, misappropriation regimes were not conceived as means of pressure to bring about a specific outcome from the targeted individuals or country authorities. Instead, the freezes were imposed with a two-fold intention in mind, one of them is rather technical in nature, while the other is political.

### A technical pre-requisite for the recovery of assets

Firstly, the objective was to prevent the flight of public assets by members of the ousted leadership and their associates. Because the deposed leaders left office abruptly and practically overnight, they retained access to public funds they could easily transfer, in addition to access to funds misappropriated at an earlier stage. The urgency of the situation made it imperative to freeze the assets immediately, in order to afford some time for the authorities from the affected countries to issue international mutual legal assistance requests.

### A political signal of support - and reconciliation

A separate, if closely related rationale of misappropriation sanctions was to support the new leaderships of Arab Spring, avoiding the misappropriation of funds that could contribute to the economic development of impoverished states. The motivation was clearly political: the asset freezes were applied as a signal of support to the post-revolutionary leaderships of Tunisia and Egypt. This goal was of key importance to the EU given that the initial European response to the protests had not been favourable to their leaders. Prior to the overthrow of the doomed regimes, most European government had been cautious about aligning themselves with the revolutionary forces. The leadership in France infamously offered help to the Tunisian government to repress the revolts. From this point of vantage, the freezing of assets of ousted leaders was a conciliatory gesture designed to make up for the initial absence of support for the Arab Spring and to build bridges with a new political elite with which Europeans had no previous links. In fact, such conciliatory gesture was all the more pertinent given that European hesitation about backing the popular protests appeared to be at odds with the EU’s declared objective of promoting democracy in its neighbourhood. The situation repeated itself three years later with the Maidan protests in Ukraine, where the freezing of assets by the EU followed a sudden change of government. Due to the similarity between the Arab Spring and the Maidan protest, characterised by a pattern of popular unrest leading to the unexpected and abrupt ousting of the leadership, the EU replicated the approach witnessed in the aftermath of the Arab Spring.

The message of support conveyed by the freezes is not merely a symbolic gesture of solidarity with post-revolutionary forces that seized power. Restoring the assets frozen to the state coffers contributes to the stabilisation of the post-revolutionary situation and of the new government. Recovered funds can be used to aid economic reconstruction. The new leaderships will find it harder to build legitimacy and to implement reforms with a meagre budget. The Council of the EU framed the adoption of freezes as part of a policy of democracy promotion. The original text of the CFSP Decision on Tunisia announced the freezing of assets “against persons responsible for misappropriation of Tunisian state funds *and who are thus depriving the Tunisian people of the benefits of the sustainable development of their economy and society and undermining the development of democracy in the country*” (author’s emphasis). Similar wording was inserted in the CFSP Decision adopting identical measures with regard to Egypt barely two months later.

The freezes were temporary in character, and were put in place with urgency, in the context of quickly evolving circumstances and on the assumption that they would be replaced by a formal request of mutual legal assistance shortly after.

The above account reveals that misappropriation sanctions do not pursue the goal of coercing any government or individual to change behaviour, which contrasts sharply with the popular belief that sanctions are invariably about changing behaviour. They lack any coercive purpose, which would be inviable anyway given that the targeted individuals are no longer in office. Having fled the country, former leaders have disappeared from the political landscape. Instead, the assets freezes are meant to prevent the flight of misappropriated funds until these can be recovered, and to send a signal of support to the leaderships that replaced the targeted leaders. Illustratively, the measure is referred to as “preventive blocking” (French: “*blocage preventif*”) under Swiss legislation.

In consequence, any evaluation of whether sanctions have been successful ought to be conducted with reference to these two sets of objectives. The freezes have been scarcely successful in attaining the goal of asset recovery, given that very few designees have been indicted. Pending the indictment, the freezes must be renewed year after year. By contrast, the measures have been successful in helping EU member states establishing links with the new leaderships. The new elites report high appreciation for the EU’s continued willingness to keep the assets frozen, which they continue to regard as a gesture of solidarity and support, in particular in the case of Ukraine.

## Explaining the Selectivity of EU Assets Freeze Imposition

After adopting a practice of freezing assets to aid their recovery, the EU has made a sparse and selective use of this tool, deploying it in some but not all occasions where it was relevant. How can this be explained?

EU capitals have different views on the effectiveness of assets freezes and their adequacy to address misappropriation. However, negative assessments prevail. As explained above, the freezes were originally agreed as temporary measures, in the expectation that they would be replaced by mutual legal assistance requests shortly after. However, several years on, few designees have been indicted. In some cases, no charges have been made yet. The slow pace at which these cases are proceeding can be explained with the help of several reasons. Firstly, the ownership of funds by members of the former leadership is often difficult to establish, as it might be hidden under front companies. Thus, investigations are often of a protracted nature. As explained by Bill Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital and Magnitsky list activist, money launderers “create a situation where the money has moved through so many different companies and so many different countries, in so many different accounts that it would b be almost impossible to recreate the trail”. Misappropriated assets were reportedly transferred to companies in Ukraine via bank accounts in Latvia and later passed through dozens of offshore shell companies in Cyprus, Belize, British Virgin Islands and the UK, among others.

Secondly, the judicial system in post-revolutionary settings is seldom free of political interference. As posited by asset recovery expert Gretta Fenner, “independence of the prosecutor general office is…often not given in countries that still struggle in democratic transition. Prosecution services all around the world, in countries with young democracy or no democracy for a long time, have actively been used as a tool of political power”. For its part, the directors of the Ukrainian Anti-corruption Bureau complains about political interference claiming that “resistance is very strong from the elites who are in power now and the more investigate, the more we face this resistance”, alluding also to the obstructive role of parliament: “Parliament is taking steps to side-line the management of the Anti-Corruption Agency and take control”. The Ukrainian judiciary performs very poorly according to indicators of independence of the judicial system produced by the World Economic Forum, which ranks Ukraine 129 out of 137 countries in judicial independence for the year 2017.

### The view from Brussels

This state of affairs is unsatisfactory from a Brussels viewpoint. The main problem that the Council of the EU has encountered is the scrutiny of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Following the 2008 landmark Kadi ruling, a Saudi citizen residing in Sweden who was successful in challenging his inclusion in the EU’s terrorism list, blacklisted individuals frequently to challenge their designations in front of EU courts. For a number of years, the Council lost a large percentage of the cases brought to Court, which obliged it to drop the designations. The requirements of the CJEU to uphold the legality of blacklists have led the Council to seek better substantiation to underpin its designations (see below), improving their solidity. However, it has also compelled the Council to broaden the designation criteria as defined in EU legislation in an attempt to fend off court challenges. In the event, these efforts have borne fruit, managing to reverse the trend. Michael Bishop, an official from the legal service at the Council Secretariat reported: “In 2012, 2013 and 2014 the Council was still losing twice as many cases as it won… In 2015 that trend was reversed; the Council won more than twice as many cases as it lost. The same applies for 2016”. Improvement to the statement of reasons has indeed allowed the Council to uphold designations. This is visible in the few cases of litigation initiated by Tunisian targets: the General Court rejected requests to annul the listings of Mehdi Ben Ali, Fahed Al Matri’s, Sirine Ben Ali and Mohamed Mabrouk.

Despite a positive trend, litigation remains a source of concern for the Council, as unfavourable rulings impinge upon its credibility and prestige. In order to satisfy CJEU requirements, the Council requests updated supporting information from the prosecutor offices of the requesting states every time that a court case is decided as well as prior yearly revision of measures, in an effort to strengthen the evidentiary basis of the listings. This constitutes an exercise especially resented by member states which have not located any misappropriated assets in their jurisdictions. Since the EU does not conduct independent investigations, the Council depends on the information submitted by foreign prosecutor offices. As former UK cabinet member David Lidington confirmed, “the information the EU relies upon to conduct its review can only be provided by an authority in the targeted state”. Deadlines have been met sometimes very narrowly by the judiciaries of the requesting states. In one instance reported to the UK House of Lords, a final piece of supporting information was only received from the Ukrainian authorities the day before the renewal of the measures. This led the chair of the Select Committee on the European Union at the UK House of Lords to complain about the resulting lack of parliamentary scrutiny, claiming that the European External Action Service (EEAS) “should have impressed upon the Ukrainian authorities the importance of providing the information in sufficient time for prior scrutiny by national parliaments, rather than a few days before adoption by the Council”.

However, the Council is unable to speed up the processes of investigation and indictment as this process is in the hands of the judiciaries of the requesting countries. EU member states are reticent about influencing foreign judicial systems, which are expected to operate independently from political pressure. In the words of David Lidington, former UK Minister for Europe, “although EU Member States are committed to supporting the asset recovery process in Ukraine, Egypt and Tunisia, there are limits to the influence we can bring to bear on their national judicial proceedings”. In sum, the Council is responsible for upholding often fragile designations in front of its own judiciary for an indefinite period, while it is not in its power to bring the investigation process to a successful conclusion. This situation has generated uneasiness and a certain degree of pessimism. In view of the outlined difficulties, several delegates privately doubt that prospects of establishing new sanctions regimes along the lines of the Tunisia, Egypt and Ukraine regimes are high. In the words of one of the interviewees, “these sanctions regimes are unsustainable in the long term”. The fragile nature of these sanctions regimes can be read off the decremental dynamics of the blacklists: The list is modified due to the dropping of existing designations, but no new entries are added. Indeed, in the absence of convictions in the requesting country, the de-listing of designees has occurred under either of the following scenarios:

1. Successful court challenges by the designee;
2. a decision by the Council to drop the entry based on the realisation that the evidentiary basis of the listing was unlikely to withstand judicial scrutiny;
3. a decision by the requesting country to drops charges, often having reached a settlement with the listed individual, which compels the EU to follow suit and remove the individual from its blacklist.

Nevertheless, assessments of the probability of resort to misappropriation regimes must be qualified: Since 2014, we have not witnessed any revolutionary movement that has culminated in the replacement of the leadership in any country. Neither has there been any (known) instance of a third country requesting the EU to freeze assets presumed to have been misappropriated by members of a leadership previously in power. Therefore, there is no evidence that discontent with existing measures will prevent the Council from resorting to CFSP asset freezes in future.

### The specificities of misappropriation sanctions regimes

An analysis of the misappropriation sanctions regimes shows that the absence of a coercive objective is not the only feature that sets them apart from other sanctions regimes. A number of differences that have hardly been captured by academic literature so far point to the misappropriation regimes as sanctions regimes that could be called sanctions regimes “implemented in support of a third party”, a neologism formulated in the absence of an established technical term. Here, the EU limits its role to support a judicial process in a third country. Catherine Ashton, former HR, presented the freezes as a policy of assistance, rather than a measure to fight corruption: “The frozen assets cannot just be released; first ownership must rightfully be transferred to the new state structures. This is a complex process. So I just wanted to inform honourable members that we are ready to assist those states concerned” (author’s emphasis).

The regime is characterised by the following traits: Firstly, the listings emanate from the third country, rather than from EU member states. Secondly, the aim of the EU is not to fight misappropriation of state assets per se. In the words of former UK Minister for Europe, they were imposed “to prevent misappropriated state funds from undermining the stability and development of the state in question”. There is a difference in nuance that points to political stability in the affected state rather than to notions such as the fight against impunity that characterise the anti-corruption discourse. Thirdly, even though the Council conducts its own review of listings prior to their periodical renewal, it relies on information that can only be provided by third state parties. The Council is not required to show that allegations against the individual are well founded, but rather that the listing criteria are met. The corollary is that individuals are de-listed as soon as the third state authorities have reached a settlement with them. As confirmed by UK Minister for Europe Alan Duncan, “those designated under the EU’s misappropriation sanctions for Tunisia, Ukraine and Egypt can be de-listed when the Council is satisfied that legal cases and judicial procedures in these countries have been concluded or discontinued”.

The practice of freezing assets to address misappropriation has been criticised by legal practitioners. Notably, Maya Lester, a British barrister experienced in acting for blacklisted individuals, complained about the potential for political misuse associated with the practice of relying on designations requested by third parties as they circumvent established processes for countries providing each other with mutual legal assistance: “The EU lists people said to be connected with former regimes (the Yanukovych, Ben Ali & Mubarak regimes) on the basis that people are under ‘judicial investigation’ in those countries for having misappropriated State funds. (…) The European Court has upheld the lawfulness of those regimes, and rejected submissions that there should adequate safeguards to ensure that there is evidence, a prima facie case, and a fair trial in those countries”. The risk that third country leaderships may be tempted to neutralise innocent political opponents by suggesting their inclusion in EU blacklists is mitigated – if only partially - by the review of the designations that precedes the yearly renewal of the measures, an exercise that involves the EEAS member states assessing the programmes made in each of the outstanding proceedings against the blacklisted individuals to ensure that they remain justified. The practice of regular review of designations has been praised by the UN Special Rapporteur Idriss Jaiziry.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, various factors underline the exceptionality of the misappropriation regimes. The freezes were originally adopted as a response to the major foreign policy crisis of the Arab Spring. Because of the atypical nature of the crisis, the EU lacked a ‘blueprint’ for addressing successful revolutionary revolts. The imposition of an assets freeze was instrumental in establishing an amicable link to the post-revolutionary elites, by meeting one of their first request to the EU and by helping European governments position themselves in favour of the new leaderships and against the ousted rulers. The Council resorted to the CFSP not only because it is an instrument often used to freeze assets, about also because the situation at hand was seen as a foreign policy matter requiring a foreign policy response. The Maidan crisis replicated this pattern, giving rise to an identical response.

Over time, the adoption of this policy came to be regarded as disappointing, although some variation exists among member states in the level of satisfaction with this set of measures. The main source of unease are the abundant court challenges. Given that designations do not come from member states, but from the requesting country concerned, the Council has to rely on a third party for the substantiation of listings. This puts the EU in the uncomfortable position of having to request information from the third state in order to be able to uphold its listings, almost inverting the notion of “petitioning state”. The circumstance that the process of indictment and convictions is remains the hands of judicial systems which are not always free from political interference further complicates the matter. The EU lacks the legitimacy to exert influence on the judiciary of a third country, as well as the means to protect it from domestic political interference.

Even though the CFSP includes the rule of law among its objectives, the EU did not regard the freezing of assets in Tunisia, Egypt and Ukraine as a measure to fight corruption in the first instance. A foreign policy rationale evidently prevailed over anti-corruption considerations. This is in consonance with EU sanctions practice: While sanctions have often been applied in response to democratic backsliding in third countries, there is no single case of sanctions imposed to address corruption other than the three misappropriation regimes in question here. Notably, none of these sanctions pits the EU against a foreign government: Because they concern deposed leaders, they do not carry a political cost to the EU. Rather, they afford the EU the gratitude of the post-revolutionary government, which perceive it as a powerful gesture of support. This is despite the fact that the misappropriation blacklists have also represented a source of tensions. In spite of the EU asset freeze, UK Treasury failed to freeze property linked to former regime figures convicted of embezzling money from Egypt, leading to accusations that ministers were “more interested in preserving the City of London's cosy relationship with the Arab financial sector than in securing justice”. Tunisia and Ukraine discreetly complain that some EU member states are unprepared to share information necessary for the domestic investigations.

The primarily foreign policy rationale of the misappropriation sanctions regimes represents a reason for its maintenance despite the meagre progress achieved so far: member states see the value of keeping them in place because of the appreciation shown by the requesting governments. Particular importance is attached to bilateral relations to this countries given that they are partners included in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) with which the EU seeks close relations on account of their geographical proximity, an increasingly unstable area.

## The EU and Swiss Legal Frameworks for Asset Freezing

### The EU Framework

#### Legal Instruments Implementing Asset Freezes

As mentioned at the outset, sanctions are agreed by a unanimous decision of the EU Council. However, to the extent that such decisions require measures that affect the Union’s “economic and financial relations with one or more third countries”, they must further be implemented by a regulation detailing the exact scope of those measures. Sanctions falling within this provision include “restrictive measures - against natural or legal persons and groups”, in particular asset freezes. Because of this dual structure, EU sanctions-based asset freeze measures, such as those related to misappropriation of public funds in third countries, always rest on two separate legal instruments: a Council Decision and a Council Regulation implementing that Decision. The regulations are directly applicable in all EU Member States, meaning that they create legal obligations directly to EU citizens and entities established in the EU, without any need for additional national implementing measures. For instance, any EU financial institution is obligated to implement an asset freeze measure immediately when a regulation enters into force – i.e., at the time it is published in the Official Journal of the European Union.

Each of the misappropriation sanctions regimes of the EU have been established through a different set of legal instruments. Chronologically, the first of these were sanctions related to Tunisia, adopted through by Council Decision 2011/72/CFSP on 31 January 2011, followed closely by those related to Egypt, adopted through Council Decision 2011/172/CFSP on 21 March 2011. Finally, sanctions related to misappropriation in Ukraine were established through Council Decision 2014/199/CFSP on 5 March 2014.
Each Decision was accompanied by a regulation implementing its economic and financial aspects: respectively, Council Regulation (EU) No 101/2011, Council Regulation (EU) No 270/2011, and Council Regulation No (EU) 208/2014. All six legal instruments have been amended several times since their adoption, primarily in order to modify their annexes which contain the lists of persons targeted by the asset freezes, their identification details, and statements of reasons for each person targeted, as well as in certain cases to amend “listing criteria”, i.e. the definition of who can be subjected to the asset freeze measure under a given decision and regulation. Very often such modifications were a reaction to judgements from the European Court of Justice, annulling specific measures due to procedural or other defects, as discussed below.

The substantive provisions of each Regulation are almost identical. For instance, the current regulation related to Ukraine contains the following provisions: Article 1 provides for the definitions used in the Regulation; Article 2 provides for the freezing of assets, and the prohibition on making assets available, to parties listed in an annex; Article 3 describes the criteria under which persons may be added to the annex as well as the information that must be provided for each entry on it; Articles 4 to 7 provide for various grounds on the basis of which national competent authorities may authorise exceptions to the freezing measures as well as other exemptions (such as for funds needed to basic living expenses, to pay for pre-existing debts, legal fees, etc.); Articles 8 and 12 provide for reporting to authorities of assets frozen as well as exchanging such information among the Member States and the European Commission; Article 9 establishes a prohibition on measures intended to circumvent the asset freeze; Articles 10 and 11 provide for limits of liability and protection from claims of EU operators; Articles 13 and 16 require Member States to designate national authorises for the implementation of the Regulations and empower the European Commission to modify contact details of national competent authorities as listed in an annex; Article 14 provides for the procedure for the Council amending the list of persons targeted by the asset freeze, including a requirement to communicate the freezing decision and the ground for listing to the targeted persons as well as to review its decision in case new evidence or observations are presented to the Council; Article 15 requires Member States to adopt domestic laws on penalties for violations of the regulation; Article 17 provides for the personal and territorial application of the Regulation; and, finally, Article 18 provides for the entry into force and direct applicability of the Regulation.

The asset freeze established by such measures requires any person or entity falling within EU jurisdiction to prevent any movement or modification of “funds” or “economic resources” “belonging to, owned, held or controlled by” any person listed on the annex to the relevant regulation as well as to refrain from making any funds or economic resources available to such parties. “Funds” encompasses cash, funds on accounts, and other similarly liquid assets, while “economic resources” are essentially any other tangible or intangible assets that have economic or financial value. The freezing obligation applies to any commercial entities and even private individuals who are in possession or control of relevant assets, or in a position to prevent them being made available. Frozen funds must be reported to domestic authorities. Failing to comply is subject to penalties as established under domestic laws of each Member State.

Interestingly, the Regulations do not contain any provisions on the conditions or process of confiscation or restitution of frozen funds to the originating Governments. In their absence, the title to any frozen assets would have to be transferred to the legitimate owner (i.e. the originating state) through some other means, such as a domestic judicial proceeding in the originating country. This would then automatically put an end to the obligation to freeze the assets, as they would no longer be “owned, held or controlled by” a person subject to sanctions, enabling them to be repatriated.

### Case Law and Analysis

EU sanctions measures implementing asset freezes in response to misappropriation of State funds in third countries have been extensively tested in the Court of Justice of the European Union, as have other forms of EU targeted sanctions. At time of writing, the General Court (its first instance) and the Court of Justice (the appellate body) had issued a total of 30 judgments related to the asset freeze regimes on Egypt, Tunisia, and Ukraine. The primary focus of those cases has been claims by those targeted that the asset freeze had violated their substantive or procedural fundamental rights, such as the right to property, the right to a fair trial, including rights of the defence, and failure to state reasons, and that the Council had made manifest errors of judgment and misused its powers in ordering the freezes.

This case law, and that related to other EU sanctions, delineates the limits of the EU’s competence in adopting and maintaining asset freezes in the CFSP context as well as procedural requirements in doing so. Prior to the Arab Spring, the EU had never adopted CFSP sanctions in response to misappropriation of State funds. Until then, they were targeted at more traditional security and foreign policy threats: proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, armed conflict, and grave internal repression. One of the questions underlying the early case law was, therefore, whether the imposition of misappropriation sanctions was appropriate under the Common Foreign and Security Policy at all, or whether other mechanism should have been used.

However, the General Court explicitly rejected any such claims, noting on the case of Egypt that the Council adopted the measures to “support the peaceful and orderly transition to a civilian and democratic government in Egypt based on the rule of law, with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms” as part of part of a “policy of supporting the new Egyptian authorities, intended to promote both the economic and political stability in Egypt”. As such, the Court ruled, the measures were “fully based on the CFSP and satisfied” the objectives of EU external action.

Importantly, the Court has affirmed that the act of using the CFSP asset freeze mechanism in relation to third state misappropriation situations is not, in itself, a disproportionate violation of the right to property of those targeted. The Court recalled that under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, such rights may be limited under certain conditions – specifically, limitations are justified to the extent that they are provided for by law, pursue an important general interest of the EU, and are proportional to the general interest being pursued. In the context of misappropriation sanctions, the Court has been satisfied that all three can, in principle, be met.

As for the general interest being pursued, the Court noted that the sanctions in the case of Egypt, by way of example, were ”part of a policy of supporting the new Egyptian authorities, intended to promote both the economic and political stability of Egypt and, in particular, to assist the authorities of that country in their fight against the misappropriation of State funds” which, in turn, was compatible with EU external policy objectives laid down in the Treaty, including the aim to “consolidate and support democracy, the rule of law, human rights and the principles of international law”.

As for the proportionality of the asset freeze in relation to that objective, the Court has emphasised that “respect for the rule of law is one of the primary values on which the European Union is founded” and therefore a weighty objective. At the same time, the Court highlighted that not all acts of misappropriation of public funds in third countries would be serious enough to be capable of undermining the rule of law to the extent that a CFSP asset freeze, and the resulting infringement of the right to property, would be a justified and proportionate measure. For an (alleged) act to qualify, the Court reasoned, it would have to be serious enough “having regard to the amount or the type of funds or assets misappropriated or to the context in which the offence took place” so that it could “undermine the legal and institutional foundations of [the country in question] and in particular the principles of legality, prohibition of arbitrary exercise of power by the executive, effective judicial review and equality before the law and, ultimately, to undermine respect for the rule of law in that country”. But within such context, the General Court ruled, the asset freeze measure would be proportional. On appeal, the Court of Justice further confirmed that an asset freeze could be justified also against a person subject to merely a pre-trial investigation for such acts, since “the effectiveness of a decision to freeze funds would be undermined if the adoption of restrictive measures were made subject to the criminal convictions of persons suspected of having misappropriated funds, since those persons would have enough time pending their conviction to transfer their assets”.

As for being “provided for by law”, the Court has noted the activities of which the targeted person is accused must strictly fall within the stated objective of the measure, i.e. constitute “misappropriation”. To establish the scope of the term misappropriation, undefined in all of the regulations, the Court has relied on an EU Directive related to financial crime, which defines it as “the action of a public official who is directly or indirectly entrusted with the management of funds or assets to commit or disburse funds or appropriate or use assets contrary to the purpose for which they were intended in any way which damages the Union’s financial interests”. In this vein, the Court noted that a person accused of having engaged in cross-border money-laundering operations from Tunisia could not legally be subjected to an asset freeze on this basis, since, while unlawful in Tunisia, it did not constitute “misappropriation”. If, however, the alleged activity indeed does squarely fall within that definition, the Court has accepted that also this “provided by law” requirement is satisfied in EU’s misappropriation sanctions and that, therefore, they do not in themselves constitute an illegal violation of the right to property.

In other words, the EU Courts have confirmed that freezing assets to counter misappropriation of third State funds is within the acceptable remit of the asset freeze tool in the EU Common and Foreign Security policy toolkit. However, the Court has also emphasised that any such measure must not only satisfy the proportionality described test above, but also a set of other, mostly procedural requirements.
According to established case law from the EU Courts, a decision to impose an asset freeze on any individual or entity must be based on a “solid factual basis”, as evidenced by information in the Council’s file. In a series of cases ruled on by the Court in late 2015 and early 2016, former Ukrainian officials subject to an asset freeze claimed that no such basis existed for the measures to which they had been subjected. When requested, the Council was only able to produce as evidence of the factual basis of the measures a letter from the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Ukraine to the EU’s foreign policy chief, listing the individuals in question and stating that “Ukrainian law enforcement authorities have initiated a number of criminal proceedings to investigate criminal acts committed” by the senior officials listed, and that “that the inquiry in question made it possible to establish misappropriation of sizeable amounts of State funds and the subsequent illegal transfer of those funds outside Ukraine”, without adding further detail.  The Court noted that the letter was so vague that the Council had not been able to shown evidence indicating that it had “any information regarding the acts or conduct specifically imputed to the [persons in question],” even when taking into account the commonly known “context” of the letter, i.e. the developments in Ukraine.

To shield the freezing measures related to Ukraine from successful challenges, the Council has taken a number of steps to build up the underlying evidence, broaden the criteria for listing the targeted persons, and elaborate on individual statements of reasons. In September 2016, the General Court issued its judgement on the case brought against the Council by Viktor Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine. As with so many earlier cases, the Court noted that the vague letter from Ukrainian prosecutors was not specific enough to justify an EU asset freeze, and went on to annul the original asset freeze against Mr Yanukovych.

However, the Court then pointed out that the Council had, since the initial freeze, modified the underlying legal instruments by adopting a modified statement of reasons for the listing of Mr Yanukovych in 2015 and had provided, as evidence underlying that new decision, a new letter from the Ukrainian Prosecutors, received in October 2014. In this letter, the Court pointed out, the authorities had described in detail “three pre-trial investigations within the framework of criminal proceedings initiated with respect to the applicant in relation to acts classifiable as misappropriation of public funds [concerning] 1. misappropriation of assets while acting in concert with others as part of the illegal funding of construction of a telecommunications network; 2. misappropriation of buildings, facilities and land, together with other public properties and the legalisation of ill-gotten gains, and 3. misappropriation of a plot of land”. The Court was satisfied that this provided sufficient proof of the solid basis for the adoption of the measure and its statement of reasons (i.e. that Mr Yanukovych was “was the subject of criminal proceedings for misappropriation of public funds or assets” in Ukraine).
Mr Yanukovych’s appeal was later rejected by the Court of Justice, which confirmed that the “the detailed nature of the charges brought against the appellant, as set out in [the 2015 letter]” established an appropriate factual basis for the asset freeze, in the absence of contradicting exculpatory evidence produced by Mr Yanukovych. It should be noted in later case law the Court has required, in cases where such contrary evidence plausibly challenges the reliability of the Council’s position, the Council must investigate further to determine the continued justification of the measure.
In summary, the European Union, acting under the Common Foreign and Security Policy by a unanimous decision of Member States, may choose to adopt misappropriation related asset freezes related against individuals in third countries if

1. the activities can be categorised as “misappropriation”, i.e. as “a public official who is directly or indirectly entrusted with the management of funds or assets” using, disbursing, or appropriating those funds contrary to the purpose to which they were intended;

2. the activities are serious enough to be capable of undermining the rule of law in that third country; and

3. the measures are based on solid factual basis, indicating, for each targeted person, at least the existence of an investigation into activities satisfying 1. and 2..

On the whole, the evolution of the misappropriation sanctions case law closely resembles that of the more traditional sanctions on terrorism and on third countries. In other words, the Courts initially acknowledged that the Council had not overstepped its CFSP discretion or human rights boundaries by ordering asset freezes on individuals, but still annulled a series of listing in the absence of any reliable evidence to support the stated reasons. Then, after people were listed with stronger evidence, the Court seemed ready to defer to the Council on their adequacy, as long as they were not evidently insufficient. Similar treatment was afforded also to the listing criteria.

### Switzerland

#### Constitutional Basis

In Switzerland, the constitutional basis for assets freezes related to the potential misappropriation of State funds by officials in third countries is established by Article 54(1) of the Federal Constitution. Freezing ordinances, which resemble the EU freezing regulations, are today issued on the basis of the Constitution and a subordinate regulation, the Federal Act on the Freezing and the Restitution of Illicit Assets held by Foreign Politically Exposed Persons (Foreign Illicit Assets Act, FIAA), adopted in 2016. In contrast to the EU, where misappropriation related assets freezes are adopted under the Common Foreign and Security Policy, like any other sanctions against third states, the Swiss legal basis is separate from that authorising the Federal Council to adopt sanctions related to international peace and security, i.e. the Federal Act on the Implementation of International Sanctions (Embargo Act, EmbA).

#### Legal Instruments Implementing Asset Freezes

The Foreign Illicit Assets Act, divided into nine sections, contains most of the substantial provisions applicable to asset freeze regimes adopted though individual ordinances.
Section 1 describes the purpose of the act and definitions used in it. Section 2 lays down three separate basis for an asset freeze, permitting this

1. in order to support future cooperation within the framework of mutual legal assistance proceedings with the country of origin, when (a) there is a change or imminent change of power in the country, (b) the level of corruption in the country is notoriously high, (c) assets appear likely to have been acquired criminally, and (d) Switzerland’s interests require freezing actions;

2. where assets have already been made subject to a provisional seizure order within the framework of international legal assistance proceedings, but (a) the third country is unable to satisfy the requirements for mutual legal assistance due to a structural failure of its judicial system and (b) Switzerland’s interests require freezing action; and

3. where a request for mutual legal assistance has been received from a third country, but (a) that country is unable to meet basic procedural requirements for such co-operation laid down in Swiss law and (b) Switzerland’s interests require freezing action.

In each three alternative scenarios a set of cumulative criteria have to be met to establish a legal basis for the asset freeze. The criteria reflect the fact that the process is not designed to be a substitute or alternative to mutual legal assistance proceedings, but rather to complement that primary tool in cases where weaknesses in the originating State’s domestic system prevent it from complying with the formal requirements of MLA.

Section 2 also provides for the procedure of adopting the lists of persons targeted by the freezes, the duration of measures, the obligation on persons and entities subject to Swiss jurisdiction to report of assets frozen, administration of such assets, the basis of which national competent authorities may authorize exception to the freezing measures, and “amicable settlement” for the restitution of assets. Section 3 provides for measures Swiss authorities may take in order to facilitate the restitution of the funds to the originating State, including through technical assistance and information sharing.

Section 4 provides for the conditions of confiscating assets that have been frozen, including when assets may be presumed to have been of illicit origin, and for protection of the rights of third parties. Section 5 lays down the procedure for the restitution of the assets frozen and confiscated to the originating State. Section 6 provides for the procedural rights of those that have been targeted by freezing measures.
Sections 7 covers aspects related to information exchange within the Swiss Government, data processing, and reporting to Parliament. Section 8 lays down penalties for violations of the Act, including the asset freeze and reporting obligations, as well as certain jurisdictional and procedural aspects related to resulting judicial proceedings. Finally, Section 9 contains provisions related to the entry into force, transitional periods, and other similar aspects of the law itself.

The targets of asset freezes are established through ordinances, adopted in relation to specific third countries in situations that satisfy on of the three criteria listed the Foreign Illicit Assets Act. At the time of writing, Switzerland maintains two ordinances based on the Foreign Illicit Assets Act: the Ordinance blocking assets in the context of Tunisia (Ordinance 196.127.58) and the Ordinance blocking assets in the context of Ukraine (Ordinance 196.127.67). A former ordinance adopted in relation to the situation in Egypt (Ordinance 946.231.132.1) has been revoked. The ordinances are annexed with lists of persons targeted by the asset freeze.

#### Case Law and Analysis

In Switzerland, the Federal Administrative Court has been invited to contemplate on the three misappropriation ordinances on a handful of occasions. Unsurprisingly, the cases brought by persons targeted by asset freezes have rested on similar arguments as in the EU case law – in particular, the infringement of the right to property and violation of the principle of proportionality. The Court in Switzerland has accepted that, as such, the freezing of assets does indeed infringe the right property, but noted (much like its EU counterpart) that such rights may be restricted under certain conditions: (i) the restriction must be based on law; (ii) it must be justified by public interest or the protection of rights of others; (iii) and it must be proportional, in other words limited to what is necessary and adequate to obtain the justified interest pursued.

The Court has also arrived at similar conclusions as the one in the EU. The interest being pursued by the measures was a legitimate interest protected by the Constitution, the Court determined, in particular protecting the financial system and reputation of Switzerland as well as furthering sustainable development and the fight against impunity, in particular where the targeted person is unquestionably closely associated with the regime of the third country. Further, the Court ruled that it is also necessary for that aim to adopt an all-encompassing asset freeze (rather than e.g. identifying specific assets that have been misappropriated), since assets could otherwise be moved beyond Switzerland’s reach before the third country authorities had time to conclude their investigations. Consequently, a measure such as the asset freeze in the context of Egypt on persons closely associated with the regime satisfied the constitutional principle of proportionality.

The Court has further ruled that a measure against any individual has to strictly satisfy the four cumulative conditions laid down in Article 3(1)(2) of the FIAA, i.e. that (a) the Government or its members have, or are about to, lose power, (b) the level of corruption in the country is notoriously high, (c) that it appears likely that the assets have been acquired through corruption, criminal mismanagement, or other felonies, and (d) that the safeguarding of Swiss interests require the freeze.

Of these, points (a), (b) and (d) are concerned with the gravity of overall circumstances in the third country and their impact on Switzerland. In a case relating to the context of Ukraine, the Court reaffirmed its position that Switzerland’s interests are inherently jeopardised should it permit assets misappropriated from third countries to flow through its financial system. It also accepted on the basis of publicly available information, such as NGO reports, that corruption in Ukraine was widely spread, and that the President had lost power – accepting, therefore, that points (a), (b) and (d) were satisfied and implicitly accepting that the situation in Ukraine, in general, was such that the imposition of asset freezes on the basis of Foreign Illicit Assets Act could be justified.

However, it would additionally have to be established, the Court stated, the assets frozen were likely to have been obtained through misappropriation or similar illicit means. Noting that the law was silent on the level of probability that should be associated with this criterion, the Court accepted that the threshold should initially be low, in order to protect the effectiveness of the measures. Given the information provided to the Court by the administration, including a letter from the Ukrainian authorities, indicated that the relevant person appeared to have been engaged in systematic illegal enrichment, the Court ruled that there was a high probability that a given asset had, indeed, been illegally obtained – without actually tracing any specific illegal activity to the specific asset. In other words, starting from a very different place, the Court reached a similar requirement as the EU Court: for an asset freeze against a specific person be justified, there has to be reliable information suggesting that the target has, personally, been involved in misappropriation or benefited from it.

Article 1 of the Foreign Illicit Assets Act adds one final criterion for an individual asset freeze to be justified, i.e. that the targeted person must be a “foreign politically exposed person” (PEP), which includes high level politicians and officials from different branches of Government, as well as their close associates. While EU misappropriation regulations do not explicitly contain any such requirement, it should be noted that under the definition adopted by the EU Court, only “a public official who is directly or indirectly entrusted with the management of funds or assets” can in fact engage in “misappropriation”. Given that the listing criteria under these regulations typically include also “natural or legal persons, entities or bodies associated” with persons suspected of misappropriation, it appears that the scope of the Swiss and EU measures are very similar.

## Comparing the EU and Swiss Legal Frameworks

In terms of enabling the freeze of assets belonging to persons suspected of misappropriation or their close associates, the legal frameworks of the EU and Switzerland appear, on the regulatory level, to be largely comparable. Both enable the authorities to impose freezing measures after determining on a credible basis that there is reason to believe that corrupt officials are likely to have engaged in mismanagement of State funds, assuming the circumstances taken as a whole are grave enough to warrant such robust response.

While, at least in some cases, the measures in both jurisdictions have rested at least partially on documentation provided by prosecutors or other authorities in the third state, neither jurisdiction explicitly provides the sources from which the evidence or information underlying the measures must originate. It may be, however, that in practice the EU Council is bound to be more reliant on information originating from the third state, as it inherently lacks investigatory powers and resources as well as subordinate agencies designed to obtain evidence. The Swiss Federal Council, on the other hand, can presumably more effortlessly rely on the law enforcement and other agencies in the executive branch.

Perhaps the most important distinction, however, is that the Swiss legislation seems to much more comprehensively address the various stages necessary in the recovery of assets to the relevant third state. Within the EU misappropriation sanctions framework, regulations speak exclusively to the freezing of assets identified as being owned, held, or controlled by targeted individuals. The exceptions and authorisations related to the release of frozen funds do not - at least explicitly - provide a basis of confiscating those assets or for their restitution to the appropriate authorities in the third state. This is bound to cause difficulties in the later stages of the recovery process. Conversely, Swiss legislation explicitly provides a legal basis for not only freezing, but also for confiscation and restitution, thereby offering a more mature basis for the recovery process as a whole. Furthermore, the Swiss FIIA equally explicitly lays down cumulative criteria that have to be met before asset freeze measures may be adopted. By contrast, the adoption EU sanctions measures is restricted only by the more general requirements developed in case law, i.e. that the measures seek to advance an important general interest of the EU, are proportional, and satisfy certain basic procedural requirements.

## Evaluating the Effectiveness of Freezes

Having reviewed the overall political and legal framework of EU asset freezes, we now turn to analyses the use of misappropriation sanctions on Tunisia, Egypt and Ukraine with a view to ascertaining their effectiveness. In addition to evaluating the cases with reference to the aims stipulated in relevant EU documents, the present section pays attention to the following set of questions:

- Which individuals were included in and removed from the blacklists, and why?
- Have the asset freezes ultimately facilitated/paved the way for asset recovery?
- What obstacles are preventing asset recovery? How successful have the requesting countries been in recovering assets at the national level?
- Have the blacklists had any impacts on designees/ imposing countries beyond the key goal of facilitating asset recovery?

### Ukraine

Despite the fact that the Ukrainian blacklist is chronologically the last one adopted, it constitutes our first case study because of its unusual complexity. Sanctions were adopted in two rounds (March and April 2014), separated by merely five weeks. According to expert Gretta Fenner, “European jurisdictions acted as fast as they ever have”, probably thanks to the fact that they closely followed the Arab Spring blueprint. The table below helps the visualisation of the designations under the EU misappropriation sanctions regimes.

**Table 1** Summary of CFSP designations for the misappropriation of state assets in Ukraine

  <dd>15</dd>
</dl>

Individuals were blacklisted at the request of the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine. All of them filed cases in front of the CJEU. Some of them did win their cases and got their designations annulled. Sometimes the EU removed entries from the blacklists while the cases were still being considered in the Court, delisting individuals listed on tenuous grounds before the Court issued its ruling, as in the case of Andriy Portnov. In other cases, such as Sergiy Kliuiev, Ukraine dropped the listing and the EU automatically did likewise. Finally, the Court has also upheld some designations. In the recent ruling on Andriy Klyuyev, the Court annulled the original designation but upheld the legality of its renewal, which reflects an evolution in which the EU has gradually improved the evidentiary basis for the designations.

The asset freezes have not yet been successful in facilitating asset recovery; however, the freezes have been in place for a relatively short time – less than five years. While the EU does not publish information on the amounts frozen – the European Commission collects it, but it is not authorised to disclose them, Ukrainian authorities reported freezes totalling 107,2 million USD, 15,9 million EUR and 135,0 million CHF in Austria, UK, Latvia, Cyprus, Italy, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Netherlands. As pointed out by Michael Howard, not a single Ukrainian political or businessman implicated in the Yanukovych corruption era has been brought to justice. The obstacles preventing asset recovery have been identified as follows: Firstly, the funds and their ownership are difficult to trace, and the Prosecutor General Office has little experience with financial investigations. However, the most significant problem is the persistence of political interference in the Office’s work, as well as the disincentives this creates for officials. These are often reluctant to move cases forward for fear of retribution. In the words of Gretta Fenner, Office members investigate “people who are still very powerful and have resources at their disposal to destroy you if they want to…If you are successful in your work, you expose yourself to risks”. In addition, on the basis of her experience as an advisor to the Ukrainian Office of the Prosecutor general, the same expert points to an initial lack of understanding of the centrality of domestic prosecutions to the success of assets recovery by Ukrainian actors.

Nevertheless, the blacklists are considered political useful beyond their performance in paving the way for asset recovery. EU members consider the misappropriation sanctions part of a broader package of sanctions imposed in response to Russian interference in Ukraine. Although formally separate and associated to different objectives, they are linked to the Crimea embargo and the sanctions addressing destabilisation of Eastern Ukraine. From this point of view, the freezes form part of a broader response to Russian interference in sovereign states, in which the EU presents itself as a united front resolutely opposed to such actions. The political significance of the measures is of central importance particularly to member states located in Russia’s vicinity, and which remain willing to uphold the freezes as a gesture of solidarity with Ukraine.

Due to its complexity, the Ukrainian sanctions regime lends itself for a comparison with the equivalent Swiss legislation. Similarly to the EU list, there were two consecutive rounds of freezing; however, the first round preceded the first round of CFSP sanctions, and the second round followed barely three weeks on. However, the faster pace of adoption of freezes in Switzerland should not automatically be seen as evidence of higher efficiency. Because the EU is a composite actor, it generally takes time for the Council to decide on legislation. In addition, the requirement to translate legislation into all EU official languages further slows the process. Similarities in the identity of designees are observable, even though the number of entries is higher in the Swiss list: The 20 initial entries of the Swiss list became 29 in the second round, while the EU blacklisting 18 in the first round and added four more entries in the second.

### Tunisia

Chronologically the first sanctions regime addressing misappropriation, it features the longest blacklist, including 48 individuals. As evident from the table below, the Tunisian misappropriation regime displays a pattern of stability that contrasts with the dynamics witnessed in the Ukrainian case. Patterns of litigation are the lowest in our sample: only 15 per cent of Tunisian targets contested their designations in court. The Tunisian case has recorded the greatest progress so far: a limited number of physical assets (an airplane and two yachts) were quickly recovered.

## The experience of UN assets freezes on Libya

The amount of stolen assets by the Gadhafi leadership in Libya is estimated to be higher than in Egypt, Tunisia or Yemen. At the outset of the civil war in Libya that started in February 2011 and led to the downfall of Gadhafi, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) froze the assets of the Central Bank, the Libyan Treasury and the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), the country’s sovereign wealth fund established to manage income generated by oil sales. Following the overthrow of the Gadhafi regime, the UNSC unfroze the Central Bank and Treasury funds in 2011. These unfreezing occurred at the request of both UN actors in the country such as United Nations Support Mission in Libya and newly-formed transitional authorities, with a view to alleviating the strangled situation of the economy and to allow for reconstruction after the .
However, the UNSC kept the LIA assets frozen. Despite calls by neighbouring countries to unfreeze LIA funds, the UNSC has maintained the freeze, not least due to political instability in the country, which erupted in a new civil war and saw the establishment of two parallel government structures. Even after the signing of the UN-brokered political agreement for form a national unity government of December 2015, the idea of unfreezing LIA funds remained controversial, with one of the two rival fractions expressing opposition while others advocated it.

The EU implemented UNSC resolutions by adopting its own legislation, as it is legally required to do. During the 2011 conflict, it imposed additional measures that went beyond the mandate issued by the UNSC, and even today it runs its own blacklist of Libyan actors. However, those individuals listed by the EU have been designated for reasons different from misappropriation. In other words, there are no autonomous EU misappropriation sanctions separate from those wielded by the UN. EU implementation of the UN ban has still been at the centre of public attention due to the existence of a loophole in the implementing legislation that allowed funds to be diverted from the frozen accounts. Some €10 billion of Libyan government funds, frozen as part of sanctions against Gaddafi’s inner circle disappeared from Euroclear, a Belgian bank between 2013 and 2017. Four Euroclear Bank accounts belonging to the LIA and its subsidiary Libyan Foreign Investment Company in Bahrain and Luxembourg contained about €16.1bn in frozen assets. However, when authorities tried to seize the funds in 2017, about €5bn remained in those accounts. This has prompted the UN panel of experts to accuse Belgium of being in violation of UN sanctions, while pointing to a previously undetected deficiency in EU legislation implementing UN sanctions.

## The “non-case” of Uzbekistan

The case of Uzbekistan represents an example of exposure and dismantlement of a grand corruption network, and promising case for assets recovery efforts. Interestingly, this case is characterised by the absence of any EU or UN action. However, there is little ground to believe that this example can be replicated. Asset recovery efforts are being facilitated by several factors. Firstly, a case was filed against Gulnara Karimova in Uzbekistan, leading to her current house arrest. This was due to the domestic political and corruption landscape of Uzbekistan, where state-organised crime is fractured between rival syndicates. As explained by corruption expert Lasslett and his collaborators, the Karimova syndicate was “expropriated and consumed by rivals who have now secured positions of dominance in the Uzbek state after the death of Islam Karimov”. In other words, here, domestic judicial system was very effective, albeit not for the right reasons. Secondly, the dangers and risks involved in operating a grand-corruption via the state machinery compelled the actors involved to rely on offshore jurisdictions to enhance secrecy and security. The presence of transactions through entities located in offshore jurisdictions, coupled with the implication of these entities in a range of criminal activities made it possible for Western authorities to intervene. Thanks to the criminal nature of these actions, the concerned jurisdiction initiated investigations, without resorting to the EU level or receiving an international mutual assistance request.

At the same time, the Uzbek illustrates why the EU has not deployed any asset freezes at all. There was no international crisis associated to either the replacement of Karimov at the head of the Uzbek leadership, nor around the exposure of Karimova’s network. Moreover, In other words, a grand corruption scandal, irrespective of its magnitude, is unlikely to attract the attention of member states foreign office unless it is associated with an international crisis. In its absence, the matter will be quietly left to the law enforcement and judicial agencies.


## CFSP Assets Freezes as effective anti-corruption instruments?

The employment of CFSP assets freezes to advance asset recovery has proved unsatisfactory at EU level and it is unlikely to be repeated in the near future. Reluctance to activate this tool is due to difficulties of legal nature. Such difficulties do not concern the suitability of the CFSP to address misappropriation, which is uncontroversial. On the contrary, the CJEU has acknowledged these measures as part of a policy of supporting new authorities, intended to promote both the economic and political stability of the requesting country and to assist the authorities of that country in their fight against the misappropriation of State funds. This fits the EU external policy of consolidating democracy and the rule of law. The Court has merely set limits on the qualification of misappropriation of public funds in third countries as threatening the rule of law. The Court reasoned that a CFSP measure would only be appropriate if it misappropriation jeopardises the legal and institutional foundations of the country in question. Instead, the key difficulty emanates from the vulnerability of designations to court challenges by designated individuals, in particular since the CJEU established that it was not admissible to freeze assets of individuals who were merely under investigation by the requesting state’s prosecutor general. This problem affects the entire blacklisting practice of the EU. However, what is unique to the misappropriation sanctions is that the listings do not come from EU member states, but from requesting states that do not back them up with sufficient evidence. Therefore, member states find themselves upholding designations of individuals not yet convicted in their home countries, and lacking sufficient information to back them up. This leaves the Council with few resources to fend off annulments by the Court of Justice, which carry a loss of prestige for the institution. This situation contrasts sharply with the blacklisting practices under regular CFSP regimes, where designations are proposed by member states, and the Council engages in listing and de-listing of entries disconnected from external processes.

### What are the Alternatives?

#### a/ Modifying the legislative framework

In the face of the unsatisfactory state of affairs, how could existing mechanisms be optimised, or replaced with less problematic options? Several alternatives could be contemplated. One of them consists in replicating the Swiss legislative framework in force since 2016. The comparative strengths of the Swiss legislation that are apparent on the textual level. Essentially, this is visible in the fact that the Swiss law addresses also confiscation and restitution, whereas the EU regulations do not. In addition, the Council of Ministers is poorly equipped for autonomously obtaining evidence, as it relies merely on the capabilities of member states’ foreign offices. This approach would remove the assets freeze from the realm of foreign policy. Its current character as a foreign policy measures prevents its use to address situations of misappropriation which are disconnect from international crises, notably revolutionary regime change. Instead, legislation enabling the adoption of EU-wide asset freezes addressing misappropriation could be moved to the framework of Justice and Home Affairs, an EU policy domain with a growing external dimension.

Another way in which this could be accomplished is by creating a horizontal sanctions list, defined as sanctions legislation devoted to address breaches in a particular field across constituencies, rather than breaches linked to a specific country.   This would not differ substantially from the current approach, given that the operative paragraphs of the three existing regimes are almost identical. This would fit the current trend towards theme-based sanctions lists that follow the model of anti-terrorism lists: Horizontal sanctions regimes to address cybercrime and the use of chemical weapons have already been established. Legislation allowing to blacklist perpetrators of grave human rights breaches has been tabled by the Netherlands under the name of “EU global human rights sanctions regime” and is currently under discussion.In an open letter, ninety NGOs have recently expressed support for the initiative, claiming that Global Magnitsky-type legislation “will provide the EU with the ability to shine a spotlight on and compel changes of behaviour in some of the world’s worst human rights violators”, and that it “has the potential to deter would-be kleptocrats”.

However, the initial Dutch proposal centres on human rights and lacks an explicit anti-corruption component, in contrast to the U.S. and Canadian version of the Global Magnitsky list. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the EU global human rights sanctions regime, provided it prospers, can be used for the purpose of fighting grand corruption. It is not believed that sufficient consensus exists among member states to adopt the anti-corruption element that is integral to the North American lists. This is despite the recognition of a link between grand corruption and the foreign policy challenges faced by the EU. Former Prime Minister of Belgium and current MEP Guy Verhofstadt encourages the EU to “go after the billionaire cronies of the Kremlin who really set policy in Moscow while laundering money in the West”, claiming that the finances and opulent lifestyles of Kremlin-lined tycoons should be fiercely scrutinised in line with EU anti-money laundering legislation”. In the absence of an anti-corruption dimension in the EU version under discussion, the creation of separate legislation dedicated to blacklisting individuals involved in grand corruption could be envisaged. The European Parliament has expressed support for anti-corruption movements in third countries in various resolutions.

#### Introducing partial reforms to the current system

The current system could be made more efficient by inserting of conditional deadlines for the renewal of measures, again following the Swiss model. The current CFSP sanctions system foresees the yearly renewal of measures; however, there is no explicit conditional aspect to it. By contrast, Swiss legislation stipulates that the extension of the original listings “is expected to yield tangible progress in pending proceedings”, and that Bern will “decide whether the freezes on these assets will be prolonged on the basis of the progress made in the respective legal proceedings”. The adoption of such conditionality component would provide an unequivocal incentive for requesting states to make progress with their investigations lest the frozen funds be released.

Finally, another option consists in imposing an EU-wide CFSP assets freeze initially, and replacing it at a later stage with national assets freezes in those countries where assets have been identified. An EU-wide freeze becomes redundant once it becomes known in which constituencies the funds are located. If assets are identified in say, four EU member states, the freeze could be upheld in the concerned countries via national measures. This would allow for the EU freeze to be revoked. Removing the CFSP freeze would eliminate the risk of challenges in the CJEU; instead, national courts would be competent. It would also release those member states where no misappropriated assets exist from the responsibility of ensuring the substantiation for listings, thereby mitigating their reluctance to effect assets freezes in future.

However, it must be emphasised that these alternatives present serious limitations: Partial reforms mitigate – such as the introduction of deadlines for renewal -, but fail to fully resolve the identified problems, while more dramatic reforms - such as replacing EU with national measures after an initial period, or moving the assets from the CFSP to the realm of Justice and Home Affairs – fundamentally alter the character and finalité of the measures.

Finally, the current system consists of a freeze at EU level, which does not entail any mechanism for asset recovery, which must take place at national level via MLAs. This system resembles the US system, which foresees the freezing of assets under the International Emergency Economic Power Act but has no provisions for confiscation. A new EU legislative framework could establish a link between both levels.
