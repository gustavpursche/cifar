title: About EU misappropriation sanctions
---
Following the revolutions in 2011 in Tunisia and Egypt and 2014 in Ukraine, the Council of the European Union (EU) imposed misappropriation sanctions on people suspected of corruption from the ousted regimes. 

These require that any assets relating to persons on the list, including houses and bank accounts, are frozen in all EU Member States.

Sanctions are imposed by the Council of the EU to promote the objectives of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP): peace, democracy and the respect for the rule of law, human rights and international law.

Each year, the Council of the EU decides whether sanctions should be renewed, amended or lifted.
