Eduard Stavytskyi was a minister between 2012 and 2014, first shortly a Minister 
of Ecology and Natural Resources and then Minister of Energy. A police raid 
shortly after the Ukrainian revolution found $5 million cash, 50 kilograms of 
gold bars and jewelery that can be hardly explained by his official salary. He 
has been accused of being involved in the privatisation of the formerly 
state-owned Mezhyhirya residence to a company linked to Yanukovych. Stavytskyi 
obtained the citizenship of Irael and he is belived to reside in Israel, where 
he uses his grandfather's name Rosenberh.
