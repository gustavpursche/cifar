Alaa, Mubarak's older son was a businessman who owned a company servicing most 
of the airlines in Egypt. Unlike his younger sibling, he showed no interest in 
politics. Both sons of Hosni Mubarak were known for their extravagant and 
luxurious lifestyles during their father's 30-year rule. Investigations coming 
out of the Panama Papers revealed Alaa as the owner of Pan World Investments, an 
investment fund for the Mubarak family of nearly US$1 billion and incorporated 
by Mossack Fonseca. Alongisde his father and older brother, Alaa was initially 
sentenced for three years in prison for diverting millions of public money to 
maintain presidential palaces. In September 2018, Alaa was arrested again, 
together with his brother Gamal, and accused of manipulating the stock market.
